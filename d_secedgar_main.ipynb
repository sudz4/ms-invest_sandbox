      "We are a member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services that, through our Lending and Financial Services products, allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money. We refer to our customers as “members” and “clients”. \n",
      "Our mission is to help our members achieve financial independence in order to realize their ambitions. To us, financial independence does not mean being wealthy, but rather represents the ability of our members to have the financial means to achieve their personal objectives at each stage of life, such as owning a home, having a family, or having a career of their choice — more simply stated, to have enough money to do what they want. We were founded in 2011 and have developed a suite of financial products that offers the speed, selection, content and convenience that only an integrated digital platform can provide. In order for us to achieve our mission, we have to help people get their money right, which means providing them with the ability to borrow better, save better, spend better, invest better and protect better. Everything we do today is geared toward helping our members “Get Your Money Right” and we strive to innovate and build ways for our members to achieve this goal. \n",
      "In order to help achieve our mission, we offer personal loans, student loans, home loans and related servicing. We offer a variety of financial services products, such as SoFi Money, SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and SoFi Relay, that provide more daily interactions with our members, as well as lending as a service which helps a broader range of borrowers to find lending solutions. We offer products and capabilities, such as SoFi At Work, that are designed to appeal to enterprises. We have also made strategic acquisitions to further expand our platform capabilities for enterprises, which we believe will deepen our participation in the entire technology ecosystem powering digital financial services. \n",
      "We have built a social area within our digital native application, which we refer to as the member home feed. The member home feed is personalized and delivers content to a member about what they must do that day in their financial life, what they should consider doing that day in their financial life, and what they can do that day in their financial life. Through the member home feed, there are significant opportunities to build frequent engagement and, to date, the member home feed has been an important driver of new product adoption. The member home feed is an important part of our strategy and our ability to use data as a competitive advantage. \n",
      "To complement these products and services, we believe in establishing partnerships with other enterprises to leverage our existing capabilities to reach a broader market and in building vertically-integrated technology platforms designed to manage and deliver our suite of products and technology solutions to our members and clients in a low-cost and differentiated manner. \n",
      "Our three reportable segments and their primary product offerings as of December 31, 2023 were as follows: \n",

      "(1)Lending as a service includes referred loans which are originated by a third-party partner to which we provide pre-qualified borrower referrals, certain loans which we originate and subsequently sell to a third-party partner, and certain loans associated with our Lantern Credit financial services marketplace platform.\n",

      "We have created an innovative financial services platform designed to offer best-in-class products to meet the broad objectives of our members and the lifecycle of their financial needs. Our platform offers our members (as defined under Part II, Item 7. “Key Business Metrics”) a suite of financial products and services, enabling them to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their finances across one integrated platform, as well as personal financial management tools and benefits to complement our products. Our aim is to create a best-in-class, integrated financial services platform that will generate a virtuous cycle whereby positive member experiences will lead to new product adoption by existing members and enhanced profitability for each additional product by lowering overall member acquisition costs and increasing the lifetime value of our members. We refer to this virtuous cycle as our “Financial Services Productivity Loop”, which is further discussed below.\n",
      "Enterprises\n",
      "In addition to benefiting our members, our products and capabilities are also designed to appeal to enterprises, such as financial services institutions that subscribe to our enterprise services and have become interconnected with the SoFi platform. We have continued to expand our platform capabilities for enterprises through strategic acquisitions, including: (i) our acquisition of Galileo in 2020, which provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions and which has allowed us to vertically integrate across more of our financial services, and (ii) the Technisys Merger in the first quarter of 2022, through which we added a cloud-native digital and core banking platform into our technology platform offerings and expanded our technology platform services to a broader international market. These expansions have deepened our participation in the entire technology ecosystem powering digital financial services, allowing us to not only reduce costs to operate our member-centric business, but also deliver increasing value to our enterprise customers. While our enterprises are not considered members, they are important contributors to the growth of the SoFi platform, and also have their own constituents who might benefit from our products in the future.\n",
      "SoFi Bank\n",
      "In February 2022, we closed the Bank Merger, pursuant to which we became a bank holding company and began operating as SoFi Bank. Golden Pacific’s community bank business continues to operate as a division of SoFi Bank.\n",
      "As a bank holding company, we offer checking and savings accounts and credit cards through SoFi Bank. We are originating all new loan applications within SoFi Bank, and we intend to continue to explore other products for SoFi Bank over time. The key current and expected financial benefits to us of operating a national bank include: (i) lowering our cost to fund loans, as we can utilize deposits held at SoFi Bank to fund loans, which have a lower borrowing cost of funds than our warehouse and securitization financing model, (ii) increasing our flexibility to hold loans on our balance sheet for longer periods, thereby enabling us to earn interest on these loans for a longer period, (iii) supporting origination volume growth by providing an alternative financing option, while also maintaining our warehouse capacity, and (iv) through deposits, providing us with meaningful member data that can allow us to better serve our members’ financial needs. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain potential risks related to being a bank holding company.\n",
      "International Operations\n",

      "Our Differentiation\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to build best-in-class offerings, we focus on four differentiators: fast, selection, content and convenience. \n",
      "(1)Fast — We aspire to be the fastest place for our members to responsibly do anything, whether it’s applying for a loan, getting a funded loan, opening an account, buying or selling a stock, uploading a mobile check, getting access to money, paying a friend, or accessing relevant financial content. Other than certain products acquired and offered through SoFi Bank, our products are all digital and we have a culture of iteration to help drive faster and faster services. \n",
      "(2)Selection — Given the digital nature of our products, the permutations of features and services that can be made available to our members across their needs to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect are significant. We will continue to iterate, learn and innovate to broaden our selection in the same way we did this year by providing our members with \n",

      "competitive interest rates on checking and savings accounts, options trading, “Pay in 4” (a buy now, pay later product), and SoFi Plus membership benefits. \n",
      "(3)Content — Our financial education, insights, research content, actionable tools and advice are designed to provide meaningful value for our members. Our carefully-crafted and personalized content is offered through our member home feed and is designed to help our members get their money right. We strive to provide digestible financial education, meaningful answers, salient information, advice, credit scores, financial calculators, investment research and financial news that enhance member loyalty and increase the likelihood that members will use additional SoFi products in the future. \n",
      "(4)Convenience — We hold ourselves accountable and aim to provide the most convenient member experience possible in terms of ease of use, ubiquity, functionality, simplicity and responsive customer service. Our long-term goal is to provide the most convenient 24x7 service and dispel the historical construct of financial service availability based on 9-5 Monday through Friday. \n",
      "Each product we offer is delivered in a member-centric way and is built and enhanced with these differentiators in mind. We believe that our member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services serves as a competitive differentiator for us relative to other financial services providers.\n",
      "We offer our members a full suite of financial products and services all in one common mobile platform. To complement these products and services, we believe in building vertically-integrated technology platforms designed to manage and deliver the suite of solutions to our members in a low-cost and differentiated manner. \n",

      "The Financial Services Productivity Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that developing a relationship with our members and gaining their trust is central to our success as a financial services platform. Moreover, we believe that some of the current frictions faced by other financial institutions are caused by a disjointed and non-seamless product experience, a lack of digital customer acquisition, subpar mobile web products instead of digital native apps and incomplete product offerings to meet a customer’s holistic financial needs. Through our mobile technology and continuous effort to improve our financial services products, we are seeking to build a financial services platform that can support all of our members’ financial services needs throughout their lifetime. \n",
      "Our strategy, which is rooted in what we refer to as our “Financial Services Productivity Loop”, is centered around building trust and a lifetime relationship with our members, which we believe will help build a sustainable competitive advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Financial Services Productivity Loop      \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to deliver on our strategy, we must develop best-in-class unit economics and best-in-class products that build trust and reliability between our members and our platform. Our acquisition of SoFi Bank was also an important step in continuing to build best-in-class unit economics and best-in-class products, as it has enabled us to achieve lower cost of funding through deposits, and improved unit economics and engagement on SoFi Money. When we do this on a member’s first product, and they later consider using an additional product, we believe they are more likely to start with our platform and we have a \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "higher chance that they will select one of our products to meet their other financial needs. This results in delivering more revenue per member with no second member acquisition costs, resulting in higher lifetime value per member. This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased profits to further improve member benefits and product experience. \n",
      "In addition to realizing the benefits of more of our members adopting multiple SoFi products, the Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy delivers operating and technology efficiencies to deliver better unit economics on a per product basis. One of the success factors of our lending business is that it is vertically integrated across our technology stack, risk protocols and operations processes. \n",

      "Our Reportable Segments\n",
      "\n",
      "We conduct our business through three reportable segments: Lending, Technology Platform and Financial Services. Below is a discussion of our segments and their primary products and non-product offerings.\n",
      "Lending Segment \n",
      "We offer personal loans, student loans, home loans and related servicing. We believe that our market opportunity within each of these lending channels is significant. Our lending process primarily leverages an in-application, digital borrowing experience, which we believe serves as a competitive advantage as digital lending becomes increasingly ubiquitous. Furthermore, our platform supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, approval, funding and servicing. Through data derived at loan origination and throughout the servicing process, SoFi has life-of-loan performance data on each loan in our ecosystem that we originate and on which we retain servicing, which provides a meaningful data asset. Net interest income, which we define as the difference between the earned interest income and interest expense to finance loans, is a key component of the profitability of our Lending segment.\n",
      "Personal Loans.   We originate personal loans to help our members with a variety of financial needs, such as debt consolidation, home improvement projects, family planning, travel and weddings, to name a few. We offer fixed rate loans with flexible repayment terms, including unemployment protection. We generally offer loan sizes of $5,000 to $100,000, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 2 to 7 years. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our personal loans.\n",
      "Student Loans.   We operate in the student loan refinance space, with a focus on prime and super-prime school loans, as well as the “in-school” lending space, which allows members to borrow funds while they attend school. We offer flexible loan sizes, repayment options and competitive rates. Within student loan refinancing, we generally offer loan sizes of $5,000 or higher, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 5 to 20 years. Within in-school loans, we generally offer loan sizes of $1,000 or higher, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 5 to 15 years. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our fixed and variable-rate student loans.\n",
      "Home Loans.   We offer agency, non-agency and, beginning in the second quarter of 2023, certain government loans (e.g., VA and Federal Housing Administration loans) for members purchasing a home or refinancing an existing mortgage. For our home loan products, we offer competitive rates, flexible down payment options for as little as 3% (or 0% for VA loans), a close on time guarantee, and educational tools and calculators. For one-unit properties, we generally offer loan sizes of $75,000 to $766,550 for in conforming normal cost areas (with exceptions for smaller loan sizes considered on a case-by-case basis), up to $1,149,825 in conforming high cost areas (GSE-eligible loans above the normal conforming limit, which is determined by county). For multi-unit properties, we offer loan sizes up to $2,211,600. In addition, we offer loan sizes up to $3,000,000 for jumbo loans (loans in the jumbo loan program), up to $1,500,000 for VA loans, and up to $472,030 for Federal Housing Administration loans in most areas. Our fixed rate home loans generally have terms of 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years. We offer adjustable rate mortgage products for conforming and jumbo loans, with a fixed rate for 5, 7 or 10 years followed by rate adjustments every six months for the remainder of the 30-year term, and for VA and Federal Housing Administration loans, with a fixed rate for 5 years followed by rate adjustments every year for the remainder of the 30-year term. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our home loans.\n",
      "Lending Model\n",
      "We originate loans through our lending business, and have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model, whereby we seek to recognize a gain from these loans and sell them into either our whole loan or securitization channels, or holding loans on our balance sheet when advantageous. This enables us to maximize our return and balance our risk by earning \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "interest on these loans for a longer period and to be selective in our sales arrangements. We expect to benefit from the continued mix towards deposit funding through operating SoFi Bank. \n",
      "We sell our whole loans primarily to large financial institutions, such as bank holding companies. In securitization transactions that do not qualify for sale accounting, the related assets remain on our balance sheet and cash proceeds received are reported as liabilities, with related interest expense recognized over the life of the related borrowing. In securitization transactions that qualify for sale accounting, we typically have insignificant continuing involvement as an investor. In the case of both whole loan sales and securitizations, and with the exception of certain of our home loans, we also continue to retain servicing rights to our originated loans following transfer. We directly service all of the personal loans that we originate. We act as master servicer for, and rely on sub-servicers to directly service, all of our student loans and GSE conforming home loans. We view servicing as an integral component of the Lending segment, as we believe our servicing function is an important asset because of the connection to the member it affords us throughout the life of the loan thereby enhancing the effectiveness of our Financial Services Productivity Loop by increasing member touchpoints and driving new product adoption by existing members.\n",
      "We rely upon deposits, warehouse financing and our own capital to enable us to continue to expand our origination capabilities. Our ability to utilize deposits held at SoFi Bank to fund our loans has lowered our overall cost of asset-backed financing relative to alternative sources of funding.\n",
      "Underwriting Process\n",
      "We have developed an extensive underwriting process across each lending product that is focused on willingness to pay (measured by credit attributes and risk scores), ability to pay (measured through income and free cash flow), and stability (measured by credit experience). A key element of our underwriting process is the ability to facilitate risk-based interest rates that we believe are appropriate for each loan using proprietary risk models through which we project quarterly loan performance, including expected losses and prepayments. We believe the outcome of this process helps us determine a more data-driven, risk-adjusted interest rate that we can offer our members. Further, our data and monitoring tools enable us to implement risk mitigation strategies quickly and efficiently, including underwriting standard adjustments to adapt our operations to changing environments and expectations. \n",
      "Our personal loan and student loan underwriting models are typically based on credit reports, industry credit and bankruptcy prediction models, custom credit assessment models, and debt capacity analysis, as indicated by borrower free cash flow. Our underwriting strategy utilizes an advanced risk model that provides refined risk separation. Home loans originated by SoFi that are agency-conforming loans are subject to credit, debt service, and collateral eligibility established by GSEs. Government loans, such as VA and Federal Housing Administration loans, are subject to the underwriting requirements established by the appropriate government agency. In addition to these requirements, agency-conforming and government loans are subject to credit eligibility overlays imposed by SoFi as well as individual investor requirements. Other non-agency loans originated by us, such as Jumbo loans, are subject to investor credit criteria, which typically includes a minimum tri-bureau credit score, established credit history requirements, income verification, as well as maximum limits on debt-to-income service and caps on loan-to-value based on an accredited appraisal. \n",
      "We also leverage our data to provide existing members a streamlined application process through automation. Across our loan products, existing members generally experience a higher approval rate than new members, subject to the existing member being in good standing on their existing products.\n",
      "Technology Platform Segment \n",
      "We provide technology platform services through a diversified suite of offerings which include an event and authorization platform accessed via application programming interfaces, a cloud-native digital and core banking platform and services related to both platforms. Our customers include financial and non-financial institutions in North and Latin America. We earn technology product and solutions revenue through the use of the platforms, either on a per use basis, or from overall license and maintenance fee service arrangements related to those respective platforms. We also offer additional add-on technology solutions to support our clients and drive engagement, such as an AI-based virtual assistant for customers of banks and financial institutions, and a real-time payment risk platform to enhance payment fraud mitigation strategies for financial customers. We continue to leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and position the Technology Platform segment for diversified durable growth.\n",

      "Financial Services Segment \n",
      "Our suite of financial services products, by nature, provides more daily interactions with our members and is, therefore, differentiated from our lending products, which inherently have less consistent touchpoints with our members. We offer a suite of financial services solutions, the most significant of which are discussed below.\n",
      "SoFi Money\n",
      "Checking and savings accounts provide a digital banking experience which allows members to spend, save and earn interest and rewards in flexible ways. We believe SoFi Checking and Savings accounts held at SoFi Bank are attractive to our members and prospective members due to our differentiated offerings, including competitive interest rates, access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage of up to $2 million through our Insured Deposit Program and the convenience and benefits of being part of a cohesive, simplified financial ecosystem within our mobile platform.\n",
      "SoFi Bank has also continued to expand its services. In the fourth quarter of 2022, SoFi Bank gained direct access to debit networks and began to perform certain services previously sponsored by the third party bank, including debit card issuance, and processing and settlement of ACH, check, and wire transactions. \n",
      "Our legacy cash management product utilizes a sweep administrator to sweep funds to and from program banks, as necessary, under a program broker agreement between SoFi Securities and the sweep administrator, as well as program account and program bank agreements with a variety of sweep program banks. Since becoming a bank, a significant portion of remaining cash management account balances are swept to SoFi Bank as a program bank. The program broker agreement provides for one-year terms that automatically renew and is terminable by either party with at least 90 days prior written notice. Historically, the program account agreements and program bank agreements provided for the rate of interest payable on the balances in a member’s cash management account. Following the Bank Merger, we began to allow members to convert their cash management accounts into checking and savings accounts held at SoFi Bank. Effective June 5, 2022, most of our SoFi Money cash management accounts no longer earn interest, as we implemented our plan to build new features only for SoFi Checking and Savings and reduce support of our SoFi Money cash management accounts.\n",
      "SoFi Invest\n",
      "SoFi Invest is a mobile-first investment platform offering members access to trading and advisory solutions, such as active investing and robo-advisory. Our interactive investing experience fosters engagement by allowing members to view and monitor other investors’ activity on the platform. We view SoFi Invest as an attractive first product for members who may later become deposit account holders or borrow with SoFi.\n",
      "Our active investing service enables members to buy and sell stocks and ETFs, as well as alternative investment funds, mutual funds and money market funds beginning in January 2024, to engage in options trading, to purchase shares in IPOs before they trade on an exchange, to buy and sell fractional shares, to engage in margin investing and to access a retirement savings account. Our robo-advisory service offers managed portfolios of stocks, bonds and ETFs. Additionally, we provide introductory brokerage services to our members and have invested heavily to create an appealing mobile investing experience.\n",
      "In connection with our approval as a bank holding company in February 2022, the Federal Reserve determined that the activities of SoFi Digital Assets, LLC in providing members with the ability to buy or sell various digital currencies through SoFi Digital Assets, LLC's omnibus account with a third-party custodian is not a permissible activity under the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y. However, under Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve has permitted us to continue our current digital assets related offering for a two-year conformance period from the date we became a bank holding company, with the possibility for three one-year extensions, provided that we do not expand our impermissible activities, except as authorized by the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y, or increase our established risk limits for total customer digital assets maintained in wallets that are accessible online, referred to as “hot wallets”, or held on balance sheet. Based on this, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to transfer the crypto services provided within SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, and began closing existing digital assets accounts. See Note 1. Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards for additional information on the transfer of the crypto services. \n",

The following is a summary of certain aspects of the various statutes and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the full text of statutes and regulations referenced below, which may be modified or amended from time to time. \n",
      "As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA, and SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, and beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB. SoFi Securities is subject to regulation by FINRA and the SEC and the Company and its affiliates are subject to supervision and examination by various state regulators.\n",
      "Bank Holding Company Regulation.   The Federal Reserve has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies such as the Company to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices, to assess civil money penalties and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. \n",
      "Source of Strength.   Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for SoFi Bank. This means that we may be required to provide capital or liquidity support to SoFi Bank, even at times when we may not have the resources to provide such support to SoFi Bank. \n",
      "Acquisitions and Activities.   The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, acquiring control of a bank, merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. \n",
      "The Company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to Section 4(l) of the BHC Act. As a financial holding company, the Company is authorized to engage in a broader set of financial activities than a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company, including insurance underwriting and broker-dealer services as well as activities that are jointly determined by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve to be complementary to financial activities. “Financial activities” is broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities, or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.\n",
      "If a financial holding company or any depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to remain well capitalized and well managed, the Federal Reserve may impose such limitations on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company as the Federal Reserve determines to be appropriate, and the company and its affiliates may not commence any new activity or acquire control of shares of any company engaged in any activity that is authorized particularly \n",

The Company must also comply with all applicable Federal Reserve requirements for financial holding companies. If a financial holding company remains out of compliance for 180 days or such longer period as the Federal Reserve permits, the Federal Reserve may require the financial holding company to divest either its insured depository institution or all of its non-banking subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company. If an insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a “satisfactory” or better record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the financial holding company will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to “satisfactory” or better, from engaging in new activities authorized particularly for financial holding companies or acquiring companies engaged in such activities.\n",
      "Limitations on Acquisitions of Our Common Stock.   The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons acting in concert from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition by a person or group of persons acting in concert of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act constitutes the acquisition of control of a bank holding company for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act. In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Under the BHCA, a company is deemed to control a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the Federal Reserve determines that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption of control established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of control of more than 5% of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company, together with other factors enumerated by the Federal Reserve, could constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company under the BHCA. \n",

The enforcement powers available to the federal banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders; to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place SoFi Bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties.\n",

Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive.\n",
      "Deposit Insurance.   Deposit obligations of SoFi Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund up to $250,000 per depositor. Deposit insurance premiums are based on assets, while taking into account various factors, including certain financial metrics and a bank’s supervisory ratings. The FDIC has the authority to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. Further through SoFi Money, members have access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage of up to $2 million through a reciprocal deposit network of participating banks in our Insured Deposit Program. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC if the FDIC finds that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. For 2023, the FDIC insurance expense for SoFi Bank was $21.7 million.\n",
      "Activities and Investments of National Banking Associations.   National banking associations must comply with the National Bank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the OCC, which generally limit the activities of national banking associations to those that are deemed to be part of, or incidental to, the “business of banking”. Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking include taking deposits, borrowing and lending money and discounting or negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt. Subsidiaries of national banking associations generally may only engage in activities permissible for the parent national bank.\n",
      "Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the OCC is required in order for SoFi Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n",

Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), which was enacted in 2018, amended the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions.\n",
      "Community Reinvestment Act.   The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate SoFi Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operation. A bank’s performance under the CRA is taken into consideration when evaluating and approving applications for charters, bank mergers, acquisitions, and branch openings. On January 1, 2023, SoFi Bank began operating under a five-year CRA strategic plan which includes measurable goals relating to: (i) CD Lending and CD Investments, (ii) CD Contributions, (iii) CD Services, (iv) Small Business Lending, and (v) Retail Services and Products. SoFi Bank’s 2023-2027 CRA performance will be examined based upon the CRA strategic plan’s five measurable goals as defined in the strategic plan and, as a result, the OCC’s standard performance evaluation criteria will not be utilized to evaluate SoFi Bank’s CRA performance throughout the duration of the strategic plan period. The OCC rates a national bank’s compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding”, “Satisfactory”, “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance”. On October 23, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC approved changes to their CRA regulations, maintaining the existing CRA ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Noncompliance) but modifying the evaluation framework to replace the existing tests generally applicable to banks with at least $2 billion in assets (the lending, investment, and services tests) with four new tests and associated performance metrics. The new CRA regulations will become effective on January 1, 2026. Failure of SoFi Bank to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit SoFi Bank or the Company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions of other financial institutions. Golden Pacific Bank, the predecessor to SoFi Bank, received a “Satisfactory” rating as of April 1, 2019.\n",
      "Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to directors and executive officers of the bank or its affiliates and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital.\n",
      "Enhanced Prudential Supervision. Both SoFi Bank and the Company, which controls SoFi Bank, had total consolidated assets in excess of $10 billion as of December 31, 2023 which subjects them to additional regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal banking laws. \n",
      "Section 1025 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB’s interpretations thereof provide that the CFPB has authority to examine any insured depository institution and with total assets of more than $10 billion for four consecutive quarters and any affiliate thereof. Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to CFPB supervision and regulation with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive.\n",
      "Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is commonly known as the “Durbin Amendment”, amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to restrict the amount of interchange fees that may be charged and prohibit network exclusivity for debit card transactions. The restrictions on interchange fees became applicable to SoFi Bank on July 1, 2023, which may negatively impact future interchange fees.\n",
      "In addition, Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule”, which generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring certain types of investment funds, applies to insured depository institutions if it, and every company that controls it, has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more and consolidated trading assets and liabilities that are 5% or more of consolidated assets. The Volcker Rule, while applicable, does not significantly impact the operations of the Company and SoFi Bank, as we do not engage in a significant amount of activity that is subject to the Volcker Rule.\n",

      "regulation applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $100 billion or more and national banks with total assets of $50 billion or more. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, and stress-test requirements. Once the Company’s or SoFi Bank’s assets are equal to or greater than the applicable asset thresholds, we will be subject to these enhanced prudential regulations.\n",
      "Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness\n",
      "Regulatory Capital Requirements.   The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and SoFi Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The Federal Reserve and the OCC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.\n",
      "The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital.\n",
      "Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk weights based primarily on relative credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average assets, less certain items such as goodwill and intangible assets, as permitted under the capital rules.\n",
      "Under the Federal Reserve’s rules that are applicable to the Company and the OCC’s capital rules applicable to SoFi Bank, the Company and SoFi Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4.0%. Additionally, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions of more than 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses and to engage in share repurchases. \n",
      "Under the OCC’s prompt corrective action rules, an OCC supervised institution is considered well capitalized if it: (i) has a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.0% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% or greater, (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. SoFi Bank is considered well capitalized under all regulatory definitions. \n",
      "Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA that, for example: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets, and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.\n",
      "Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if: (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital \n",

      "Safety and Soundness Standard. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the FDIA establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, and compensation and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\n",
      "Dividend Restrictions\n",
      "The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries through the payment of dividends or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including, with respect to SoFi Bank, depositors of SoFi Bank, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\n",
      "Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends on regulatory capital instruments unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, under Federal Reserve policy, the Company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend on regulatory capital instruments that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the Company’s capital structure. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer. See “Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.\n",
      "Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, under the National Bank Act, SoFi Bank generally may, without prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend so long as the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, in the current year do not exceed net income for the current year to date plus retained net income for the prior two years.\n",
      "Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates\n",
      "There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that \n",

Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be conducted under terms and conditions, including credit standards, which are at least as favorable to the bank as prevailing market terms. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or the furnishing of any service.\n",
      "Consumer Financial Services Laws and Regulations \n",
      "We are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices, which can be referred to as “UDAAP”, and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. Prior to January 1, 2024, the OCC examined SoFi Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforced CFPB rules with respect to SoFi Bank. As noted above, beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion.\n",
      "Truth in Lending Act.   The TILA and Regulation Z, which implements it, require lenders to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information concerning certain terms and conditions of their loan and credit transactions prior to the consummation of a credit transaction and, in the case of certain education, mortgage, and open-end loans, at the time of a loan solicitation, application, approval and origination of a credit transaction. TILA also regulates the advertising of credit, including limitations on co-branding private education lender’s products with educational institutions in the marketing of private education loans, and gives borrowers, among other things, certain rights regarding updated disclosures and periodic statements, security interests taken to secure the credit, the right to rescind certain loan transactions, a right to an investigation and resolution of billing errors, and the treatment of credit balances. For certain types of credit transactions, lenders are not permitted to originate loans with certain high-risk features, such as negative amortization and balloon payments, and must provide certain consumer protections during the underwriting and origination process, such as providing a right to an appraisal of mortgaged property, and verifying the consumer’s ability to repay the loan prior to making a decision to approve an application for the loan. Private education lenders must provide multiple disclosures to applicants under TILA and must provide applicants with 30 days in which to accept or reject a loan offer as well as the right to rescind the loan transaction for three business days following receipt of the Final TILA disclosure. \n",
      "Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.   The federal RESPA and Regulation X, which implements it, require certain disclosures to be made to the borrower at application, as to the lender’s initial disclosures (or good faith estimate) of loan origination costs, and at closing with respect to the real estate settlement statement; apply to certain loan servicing practices including escrow accounts, member complaints, servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, error resolution and loss mitigation. RESPA also prohibits giving or accepting any fee, kickback or a thing of value for the referral of real estate settlement services, and giving or accepting any portion of any fee charged for rendering a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed. To the extent that a lender makes or receives a referral to a third-party with whom it has an affiliated business arrangement, for settlement services, RESPA requires a disclosure to the customer of the affiliation to the service provider. For most home loans, the time of application (loan estimate) and time of loan closing disclosure requirements for RESPA and TILA have been combined into integrated disclosures under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule. \n",
      "Equal Credit Opportunity Act.   The federal ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or any applicable state law. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application. ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers and certain small businesses with timely responses to applications for credit, including notices of adverse action taken on credit applications. \n",
      "Fair Housing Act.   The federal FHA applies to credit related to housing and prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and handicap. The FHA prohibits discrimination in advertising regarding the sale or rental of a dwelling, which includes mortgage credit discrimination. The FHA may place restrictions on a creditor’s targeted marketing strategies, due to the risk that such strategies may increase a creditor’s fair lending risk. \n",

The federal FCRA, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. FCRA requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report and requires persons that furnish loan payment information to credit bureaus to report such information accurately. We are also required to perform a reasonable investigation in the event we receive indirect disputes from the credit bureaus about the accuracy of our credit reporting for a particular consumer and to update any inaccurate information we discover. FCRA also imposes disclosure requirements on creditors who take adverse action on credit applications based on information contained in a consumer report or received from a third party and requires creditors who use consumer reports in establishing loan terms to provide risk-based pricing or credit score notices to affected consumers. FCRA also imposes rules and disclosure requirements on creditors’ use of consumer reports for marketing purposes, which impacts our ability to use consumer reports and prescreened lists to market consumer loans through direct mail and other means. \n",
      "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.   The federal FDCPA provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts. The FDCPA limits certain communications with third parties, imposes notice and debt validation requirements, and prohibits threatening, harassing or abusive conduct in the course of debt collection. While the FDCPA applies to third-party debt collectors, and not original creditors, debt collection and loan servicing laws of certain states impose similar requirements on creditors who collect their own debts or contract with third parties to collect their debts. In addition, the CFPB prohibits UDAAP in debt collection, including first-party debt collection. The CFPB’s Regulation F, which implements the FDCPA, addresses communications in connection with debt collection, interprets and applies prohibitions on harassment or abuse, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices in debt collection, and clarifies requirements for certain consumer-facing debt collection disclosures.\n",

The MLA also requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product. \n",
      "Electronic Fund Transfer Act and NACHA Rules.   The federal EFTA, and Regulation E that implements it, provide guidelines and restrictions on the provision of electronic fund transfer services to consumers, and on making an electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts. In addition, transfers performed by electronic transfers using the ACH network are subject to detailed timing and notification rules and guidelines administered by the NACHA. Most transfers of funds in connection with the origination and repayment of loans are performed by electronic fund transfers, such as ACH transfers. We obtain necessary electronic authorization from borrowers and investors for such transfers in compliance with such rules. EFTA requires that lenders make available loan payment methods other than automatic preauthorized electronic fund transfers, and prohibits lenders from conditioning the approval of a loan transaction on the borrower’s agreement to repay the loan through automatic fund transfers.

We have implemented various anti-money laundering policies and procedures to comply with applicable federal anti-money laundering laws, regulations and requirements, such as designating a BSA officer, conducting an annual risk assessment, developing internal controls, independent testing, training, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting. We apply the customer identification and verification program rules pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act amendments to the BSA and its implementing regulations and screen certain customer information against the list of specially designated nationals and other lists of sanctioned countries, persons, and entities maintained by the Treasury Department’s OFAC. Additionally, SoFi Digital Assets, LLC is registered with and regulated by the FinCEN as a MSB with respect to its digital assets business activities, which were transferred in the first quarter of 2024. As an MSB, we are subject to FinCEN regulations implementing the BSA, which requires MSBs to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other requirements. Similarly, SoFi Bank is a financial institution under the BSA that is required to implement a risk-based anti-money laundering program, including customer identification procedures, currency transaction reporting, suspicious activity monitoring and reporting and other recordkeeping requirements.

These sanctions, which are administered by OFAC, take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.

We are subject to CFPB supervision and regulation of our loan servicing activities conducted by SoFi Bank and SoFi Lending Corp. even in scenarios where we have engaged third-party servicers such as MOHELA to service our private education loans and Cenlar FSB to service our home loans. In addition, for so long as SoFi Lending Corp. acts as servicer of any of our private education loans, we are subject to certain state licensing requirements applicable to student loan servicers even though we have engaged MOHELA to service our private education loans, as we retain master servicing rights. With respect to our broader consumer loan business, we are subject to federal and state laws regulating loan servicers. We are impacted by these rules even though we service loans we originate, and engage third parties like MOHELA and Cenlar FSB to service certain types of loans, because some state laws, such as the California Rosenthal Act, apply to creditors and first party servicers. Some state laws also apply to parties that indirectly service loans through the use of third-party servicer contracts. Additionally, we sell some of the loans we originate to third parties and are therefore subject to laws governing parties that service loans on behalf of another person to whom the debt is owed. We are currently licensed as a loan servicer in several states and may be required to seek additional licenses. If we seek additional licenses, a state has in the past and may in the future impose fines, restrict our activity in that state, or seek other relief for activity conducted prior to the issuance of a license. \n",
      "Other State Lending Laws.   SoFi Lending Corp. will continue to service certain of our loans, and our money transmission activities will continue to be provided by SoFi Digital Assets, LLC. Consequently, in addition to applicable federal laws and regulations governing our operations, our ability to service loans through SoFi Lending Corp. in any particular state, and transmit money to or from any particular state, is subject to that state’s laws, regulations and licensing requirements, which may differ from the laws, regulations and licensing requirements of other states. State laws often include fee limitations and disclosure and other requirements. Many states have adopted lending regulations that prohibit various forms of high-risk or sub-prime lending and place obligations on lenders to substantiate that a member will derive a tangible benefit from the proposed credit transaction and/or have the ability to repay the loan. These laws have required most lenders to devote considerable resources to building and maintaining automated systems to perform loan-by-loan analysis of points, fees and other factors set forth in the laws, which often vary depending on the location of the mortgaged property. Many of these state lending laws are vague and subject to differing interpretation, which exposes us to some risks. The number and complexity of these laws, and vagaries in their interpretations, present compliance and litigation risks from inadvertent error and omissions which we may not \n",

The laws, regulations and rules described above are subject to legislative, administrative and judicial interpretation, and some of these laws and regulations have been infrequently interpreted or only recently enacted. Infrequent interpretations of these laws and regulations or an insignificant number of interpretations of recently-enacted laws and regulations can result in ambiguity with respect to permitted conduct under these laws and regulations. Any ambiguity under the laws and regulations to which we are subject may lead to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions and private causes of action, such as class-action lawsuits, with respect to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. \n",
      "Risk Retention Regulations.   Our balance sheet is impacted by the risk retention regulations adopted by the SEC that became effective for non-mortgage securitizations in 2016. These rules require issuers of asset-backed securities or persons who organize and initiate asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion of the underlying assets’ credit risk. \n",
      "Marketing Regulations.   Our marketing and other business practices are subject to federal and state regulation and our expansion into new product offerings, including ETFs and, beginning in January 2024, alternative investment funds, mutual funds and money market funds, under the SoFi Invest product, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. For example, we and the FTC entered into the FTC Consent Order regarding savings calculations in our student loan refinancing advertisements. In addition, we are subject to the TCPA, which regulates, among other things: (i) the use of automated telephone dialing systems to make certain calls or text messages to cellphones without prior consent, and (ii) certain calls and text messages to numbers properly registered on the federal do not call list without permission or an established business relationship, and the Federal CAN-SPAM Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, and analogous state laws, to the extent that we market credit or other products and services by use of email or telephone marketing. \n",

We are subject to the United States Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\n",

The securities issued in the securitizations that we sponsor are not registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under any state securities laws. We do not offer securitized products to retail investors. We receive opinions from legal counsel for each securitization confirming that the relevant issuing entity is not required to register under the Investment Company Act in reliance on the exclusion available under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act, although other exemptions or exceptions may also be available.\n",

      "SoFi Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, the “SEC Net Capital Rule”, which requires the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital. The SEC Net Capital Rule is designed to protect members, counterparties, and creditors by requiring a broker-dealer to have sufficient liquid resources available to satisfy its financial obligations. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer’s readily available liquid assets, reduced by its total liabilities (other than approved subordinated debt). Among other things, the SEC Net Capital Rule requires that a broker-dealer provide notice to the SEC and FINRA if its net capital is below certain required levels. There are also certain “early warning” requirements that apply. Our affiliates operating outside the United States may also be subject to other regulatory capital requirements imposed by non-U.S. regulatory authorities. \n",

      "Privacy and Consumer Information Security \n",
      "In the ordinary course of our business, we access, collect, store, use, transmit and otherwise process certain types of data, including personal information, which subjects us to certain federal, state and foreign privacy and information security laws, rules, industry standards and regulations designed to regulate consumer information and data privacy, security and protection, and mitigate identity theft. These laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of personal information, and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their personal information and disclosure of it to third parties. The GLBA requires us to disclose certain information sharing practices to consumers, and any subsequent changes to such practices, and provide an opportunity for consumers to opt out of certain sharing of their non-public personal information. This may limit our ability to share personal information with third parties for certain purposes, such as marketing. In addition, the CFPB is expected to issue a new rule regulating the disclosure of consumer information, which may limit our ability to receive or use personal information and other consumer information and records supplied by third parties, or share information with third parties. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected individuals and government authorities in the event of a data or security breach or compromise, including when a consumer’s personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. These laws may also require us to notify relevant law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach. Some laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information. \n",
      "On January 1, 2020, the CCPA took effect, directly impacting our California business operations and indirectly impacting our operations nationwide. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. While personal information that we process that is subject to the GLBA is exempt from the CCPA, the CCPA regulates other personal information that we collect and process in connection with the business. Effective January 1, 2023, the CPRA, which amended the CCPA, imposed additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also created a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. \n",
      "In addition to California, several other states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA. Certain of these laws are in force and others will enter in effect in the coming years. Like the CCPA, these laws create obligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data. Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also states that are strongly considering comprehensive privacy laws and it is anticipated that other states will be considering these laws in the future. Further, Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. In addition, other states have proposed and/or passed legislation that regulates the privacy and/or security of certain specific types of information. For example, a small number of states have passed laws that regulate biometric data specifically and Washington has passed a law that governs health data, with “health data” defined broadly. These various privacy and security laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. \n",

      "•Integrating a diversity, equity and inclusion lens into everything we do; \n",

Our DE&I objective is to create a company culture where every employee feels like they genuinely belong, are respected and valued, and can do their best work. This approach will unlock the potential of the organization and is a competitive advantage for SoFi. \n",
      "One of the ways we ensure our global, diverse employees feel a sense of connection to our strategy and mission is through our quarterly Objectives and Key Results (“OKR”) process. Each year, company priorities are developed in partnership with our executive staff team and the SoFi Leadership Group. These priorities are shared with the company at the beginning of each year, as well as quarterly. Teams and individuals are then able to map their OKRs to the company objectives, which align all employees on the company vision and strategy. For the last three years, our #1 company priority has been culture and DE&I. As part of this commitment to improving representation at all levels of the company, we set ambitious three-year goals in 2020: to increase our total URG population to 60%, and to increase URG representation in management to 50%. Based on voluntary employee self-identification data by our U.S.-based workforce, as of December 31, 2023: \n",

      "Creating lasting and meaningful change is not a short-term project. Improving DE&I requires a multi-faceted approach to ensure that all employees are having an equitable experience. This journey requires transparency and accountability at all levels of the organization. To help meet and achieve our long-term goals, we have focused on fair and transparent processes in talent assessment and hiring, to performance management, career progression and retention, we have developed programs that support our all employees across all stages of the employee lifecycle. \n",

SoFi proudly sponsors nine Employee Resource Groups, known internally as SoFi Circles. These employee-led communities help build high-trust relationships, create safe and brave spaces to raise awareness on important, pertinent topics, and help our organization thrive by fostering a sense of community. Examples of their programs include: listen & learn workshops, cultural events, keynote speaker series, give back donation initiatives, and volunteering opportunities for all.

To support the mental health of our employees, we offer a benefit that allows our employees to meet with coaches and clinical care providers at no cost to them. Our tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs in the U.S. provide financial support to our employees that allows them to advance their education and pay off existing student loan debt. \n",

      "In evaluating our company and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects, in which case the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to our business being adversely affected, negatively impacted or harmed will include an adverse effect on, or a negative impact or harm to, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue or our future prospects. The material and other risks and uncertainties summarized in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below.

      "We operate in rapidly evolving industries, and have limited experience in parts of our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments, which may make it difficult for us to successfully identify and address the risks and uncertainties we face. \n",
      "We operate in rapidly evolving industries which may make it difficult to quickly identify risks to our business and evaluate our future prospects. In addition, in recent years, we have rapidly expanded our operations to include or expand, among other things, deposit accounts, credit cards, investment services, technology solutions, home loan originations, and international operations, and we have limited experience in these areas. In the first quarter of 2022, we acquired a bank charter and face risks as a result of our lack of experience operating a bank and as a bank holding company. We also acquired Technisys in the first quarter of 2022, which furthered our international expansion into Latin America and introduced new risks due to our limited history of operations in certain Latin American countries. In 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a fintech mortgage lender, which expanded our home loan business.\n",
      "In addition to the recent events above, we face numerous challenges to our success, including our ability to: \n",
      "•increase or maintain the number, volume and types of, and add new features to, the loans we extend to our members as the market for loans evolves and as we face new and increasing competitive threats;\n",
      "•successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions, including continuing to integrate Wyndham’s technology and employees, performing functions in home loans origination, such as home loans processing and underwriting, which we have not previously performed, and managing the origination of new home loan types;\n",

      "•adequately respond to macroeconomic and other exogenous challenges, including continued government efforts to curb inflation, which may impact the overall economy and affect demand for our products and services, market volatility, particularly in the financial services industry, changes in consumer confidence, consumer discretionary spending and loan delinquency rates, pandemics or other health-related crises, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the ongoing war in Ukraine; \n",

      "•anticipate and react to changes in an evolving regulatory and political environment. \n",
      "We may not be able to successfully address the risks and uncertainties we face, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. \n",
      "We have a history of losses, and may experience net losses in the future and there is no assurance that our revenue and business model will be successful. \n",
      "We have a history of net losses prior to the fourth quarter of 2023. We may incur net losses in the future, and such losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We will need to generate and sustain significant revenues for our business generally, and achieve greater scale and generate greater operating cash flows from our Financial Services segment, in particular, in future periods, as well as successfully navigate the macroeconomic environment, in order to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing, technology, and products and services in order to enhance our brand recognition and our value proposition to our members, prospective members and clients in our technology platform business, and these additional costs will create further challenges to maintaining or increasing near-term profitability. Our general and administrative expenses have in the past and may in the future increase to meet the increased compliance and other requirements associated with operating as a public company and a bank holding company, operating a bank, and evolving regulatory requirements. See “Regulatory, Tax and Other Legal Risks—As a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, and changes in laws and regulations applicable to bank holding companies could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations”.\n",
      "We are continuously refining our revenue and business model, which is premised on creating a virtuous cycle for our members to engage with more products across our platform, a strategy we refer to as the Financial Services Productivity Loop, \n",

      "and, with respect to our Technology Platform segment, adoption by clients of additional platform as a service offerings. There is no assurance that our revenue and business model or any changes to our revenue and business model to better position us with respect to our competitors will be successful. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue sufficiently to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur losses and we may be unable to maintain profitability, for a number of reasons, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, differences between our assumptions and estimates and results, the effects of macroeconomic conditions and other unknown events. \n",
      "We have experienced rapid growth in recent years, including through the addition of new products and lines of business and into new geographies, which may place significant demands on our operational, risk management, sales and marketing, technology, compliance, and finance and accounting resources. \n",
      "Our rapid growth in certain areas of our business in recent years, primarily within our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments, as well as operating a bank and as a bank holding company, has placed significant demands on our operational, risk management, sales and marketing, technology, compliance, and finance and accounting infrastructure, and has resulted in increased expenses, a trend that we expect to continue as our business grows. In addition, we are required to continuously develop and adapt our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the consumer financial services market, changing technologies, evolving fraud, privacy and information security landscape, and regulatory developments, both domestically and internationally, relating to our existing and projected business activities. Our future growth will depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system able to address such growth, our ability to grow and optimize deposit balances, and our ongoing ability to demonstrate to our regulators that our risk management and compliance practices are growing in a commensurate fashion, all of which has required and we expect will continue to require us to incur significant additional expenses, expand our workforce and commit additional time from senior management and operational resources. We may not be able to manage supporting and expanding our operations effectively, and any failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to increase the scale of our business, generate projected revenue and control expenses. \n",
      "Our results of operations and future prospects depend on our ability to retain existing members and attract new members. We face intense and increasing competition and, if we do not compete effectively, our competitive positioning and our operating results will be harmed. \n",
      "We operate in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, and our results of operations and future prospects depend on, among others: \n",
      "•the continued growth and engagement of our member base;\n",
      "•our ability to monetize our member base, including through the use of additional products by our existing members;\n",
      "•our ability to acquire members at a lower cost; and\n",
      "•our ability to increase the overall value to us of each of our members while they remain on our platform (which we refer to as a member’s lifetime value).\n",
      "We expect our competition to continue to increase, as there are no substantial barriers to entry to certain of the markets we serve. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, particularly with respect to our financial services products, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, and a larger customer base than we do. This allows them to potentially offer more competitive pricing or other terms or features, a broader range of financial products, or a more specialized set of specific products or services, as well as respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in member preferences. In addition to established enterprises, we may also face competition from early-stage companies attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are. Our existing or future competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. This could attract current or potential members away from our services and reduce our market share in the future. Additionally, when new competitors seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, these competitors sometimes undercut, or otherwise exert pressure on, the pricing terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share and/or our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. \n",
      "We currently compete at multiple levels with a variety of competitors, including: \n",
      "•other personal loan, student loan refinancing, in-school student loan and home loan lenders, including other banks and other financial institutions, as well as credit card issuers, that can offer more competitive interest rates or terms; \n",
      "•banks and other financial institutions, with respect to our checking and savings accounts; \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",

      "•rewards credit cards provided by other financial institutions, with respect to our SoFi Credit Card;\n",

      "•other mortgage lenders, including fintech-focused lenders, and other companies for our home loans;\n",
      "•other technology platforms with respect to the enterprise services we provide, such as technology products and solutions via Galileo and Technisys;\n",
      "•other content providers for subscribers to our financial services content, including content from alternative providers available to our subscribers through our Lantern Credit service, which is a financial services aggregator providing marketplace lending products, and various enterprise partnerships; and \n",
      "•other financial services firms offering employers a comprehensive platform for employees to build financial well-being through student loan and 529 educational plan contributions, educational tools, and financial resources, all of which we provide through SoFi At Work.\n",
      "We believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including, among others, the following: \n",
      "•the size, diversity and lifetime value of our member base and technology platform clients; \n",
      "•our ability to introduce successful new products and services, as well as new or improved technologies, or to iterate and innovate on existing products or services to satisfy evolving member and technology platform client preferences or to keep pace with market trends;\n",
      "•our ability to diversify our revenue streams across our products and services, and cost effectively acquire new members and technology platform clients;\n",
      "•the timing and market acceptance of our products and services, including developments and enhancements to those products and services, offered by us and our competitors;\n",
      "•member and technology platform client service and support efforts; \n",
      "•selling, marketing and promotional efforts; \n",
      "•our ability to compete on price, particularly with respect to SoFi Invest and the Technology Platform where demand for our products and services may be affected if we are unable to compete with other brokerages or technology-as-a-service providers on price;\n",
      "•our ability to offer competitive interest rates on deposit accounts;\n",
      "•the ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors; \n",
      "•our ability to attract and retain talent;\n",
      "•changes in economic conditions, and regulatory and policy developments; \n",
      "•our ability to successfully operate a national bank, grow deposits and realize the potential benefits to our members; \n",
      "•our ability to successfully scale our products and services and execute on our Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy and our other business plans, including successfully integrating our acquisitions and diversifying our technology platform clients into new industry verticals and new geographies; \n",
      "•general market conditions and their impact on our liquidity and ability to access funding; \n",
      "•the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts from current efforts to curb inflation, stock market volatility, changes in consumer confidence, consumer discretionary spending, and any changes in loan default rates, and related developments on the lending and financial services markets we serve; and \n",
      "•our brand strength relative to our competitors. \n",
      "Our current and future business prospects demand that we act to meet these competitive challenges but, in doing so, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if we, for example, increase marketing or other expenditures or make new expenditures in other areas. Competitive pressures could also result in us reducing the annual percentage rate on the loans we originate, increasing the annual percentage rate we pay on the checking and savings product, charging fees for services we currently provide for free, incurring higher member or technology platform client acquisition costs, or make it more difficult for us to grow our loan originations in both number of loans and volume for new as well as existing members or expand the adoption of additional products by our current, or acquire new, technology platform clients. All of the foregoing factors and events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. \n",

      "Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were put into FDIC receivership in March 2023 and First Republic Bank was put into FDIC receivership in May 2023. These market developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in the safety and soundness of certain banks. As a result, although we have not observed a decline in our deposits to date, our members may choose to maintain deposits with other financial institutions or spread their deposit funds among multiple financial institutions. The closure of financial institutions, even if such financial institutions are unrelated to our business, may result in a deterioration of consumer confidence in banks and the banking system more broadly as well as declines in the price of our stock or reluctance of our members to use our products and services.\n",
      "Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program, a new emergency lending program for FDIC-insured banks, as well as certain U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Under the Bank Term Funding Program, the Treasury Department provided $25 billion of credit protection to the Federal Reserve Banks, in order to provide loans with terms up to one year secured by certain government securities held by eligible financial institution borrowers. The program was established to reduce the need for eligible borrowers to sell the securities in times of stress, thus, mitigating the risk of potential losses on the sale of such securities. On January 24, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced that the program would cease making new loans, as scheduled, on March 11, 2024. There is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve would establish a similar facility in the future or that the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve will provide access to uninsured funds in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion.\n",
      "It is likely that, if the banking sector deteriorates, the U.S. and/or other global economies would be adversely affected, including facing the possibility of a recession, the duration and severity of which is difficult to predict. These developments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "Our future growth depends significantly on our branding and marketing efforts, and if our marketing efforts are not successful or we receive negative publicity, our business and results of operations will be harmed. \n",
      "We have invested significantly in our brand and believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our success. Our ability to attract members depends in large part on the success of these marketing efforts and the success of the marketing channels we use to promote our products. Our marketing channels include, but are not limited to, earned media through press, social media and search engine optimization, as well as paid advertising, such as online affiliations, search engine marketing, digital marketing, social media marketing, influencer marketing, offline partnerships, out-of-home, direct mail, lifecycle marketing and television and radio advertising. Our ability to compete for, attract and maintain members, lending counterparties, marketing partners and other partners relies to a large extent on their trust in our business, our reputation and the value of our brand. While our goal remains to increase the strength, recognition and trust in our brand by increasing our member base and expanding our products and services, if any of our current marketing channels becomes less effective, if regulatory requirements, including the FDIC’s advertising rules, restrict or diminish our ability to use these channels, if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, if we receive negative publicity or fail to maintain our brand, if the cost of using these channels significantly increases or if we are not successful in generating new channels, we may not be able to attract new members or increase the activity of our existing members on our platform in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in the size, value or the overall number of loans we originate, or member selection and utilization of other SoFi products such as SoFi Money, SoFi Invest and SoFi Credit Card, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. In addition, negative publicity can adversely affect our reputation and damage our brand, and may arise from many sources, including actual or alleged misconduct, errors or improper business practices by employees, employee claims of discrimination or harassment, product failures, existing or future litigation or regulatory actions, inadequate protection of consumer information by us or our third-party service providers, data breaches, matters related to or affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and Nasdaq listing requirements and media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative publicity or allegations could reduce demand for our products, result in a decrease in the price of our stock, undermine the loyalty of our members and the confidence of our lending counterparties and technology platform clients, impact our partnerships, reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees or lead to greater regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to the attrition of our members, lending \n",

      "counterparties, technology platform clients and harm our results of operations. In addition, we and our officers, directors and/or employees have been, and may in the future be, named or otherwise involved in litigation or claims, including employment-related claims such as workplace discrimination or harassment, which could result in negative publicity and/or adversely impact our business, even if we are ultimately successful in defending against or litigating such claims.\n",
      "Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of our size and profile in the financial services industry. Moreover, negative public opinion has in the past and could in the future result from actions by the financial services industry generally, including due to the failure of one or more additional banks, or by certain members or individuals in the industry and can adversely affect our reputation with no actual or alleged actions on our part. For example, public opinion of the financial services industry was negatively impacted following the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and generally resulted in decreases in the stock prices of financial services companies.\n",
      "Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales and marketing practices; home loan or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions; obligations and interests with and among our members or customers; environmental, social and governance practices; litigation or regulatory actions taken by us or to which we are a party; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of member or customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm members or customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct.\n",
      "Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. For example, our marketing strategy includes an emphasis on social media. Social media provides a powerful medium for consumers, employees and others to communicate their approval of or displeasure with a business. This aspect of social media is especially challenging because it allows any individual to reach a broad audience with an ability to respond or react, in near real time, with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. We monitor social media metrics for their impact on our business but if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could “go viral”, causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation, and our business, whether or not factually accurate, including a significant withdrawal of deposits from SoFi Bank within a short period of time.\n",
      "Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\n",

We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives and/or commitments regarding our employees, diversity, equity and inclusion goals, and other matters in our ESG Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives and commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation, result in ESG-focused investors not purchasing and holding our stock, or otherwise materially harm our business.\n",

      "Although we have begun to hold loans on-balance sheet for longer periods, when we sell our personal loans, student loans and home loans, we sell to a concentrated number of whole loan purchasers. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of a business is concentrated with a limited number of parties. It is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our loans by these or other purchasers. In addition, purchases of our loans by these purchasers have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including economic conditions, the availability of alternative investments, changes in the terms of the loans, loans offered by competitors, prevailing interest rates and a change in business plan, liquidity or strategy by the purchaser. If any of these purchasers significantly reduces the dollar amount of the loans it purchases from us, we may be unable to sell those loans to another purchaser on favorable terms or at all, which may require us to reduce originations or hold additional loans on balance sheet and may reduce our flexibility in making financing decisions. In addition, the loss of one or more significant purchasers of our loans could increase the volatility of the mark-to-market methodology we use to determine the fair value of the loans we hold on balance sheet. This may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, capital requirements, liquidity and cash flows.\n",

Any reduction in the amount of revenues that we derive from these clients, without an offsetting increase in new sales to other clients, has had and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our future operating results.

For example, to provide our checking and savings account, cash management account, credit card and other products and services, we rely on third parties that we do not control, such as payment card networks, our acquiring and issuing processors, payment card issuers, various financial institution partners, systems like the ACH, and other partners. We rely on these third parties for a variety of services, including the transmission of transaction data, processing of chargebacks and refunds, settlement of funds, and the provision of information and other elements of our services. In addition, external content providers provide us with financial information, market news, charts, option and stock quotes, digital assets quotes, research reports and other fundamental data that we provide to our members. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in the quality of their service or performance, could be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, third parties may rely on artificial intelligence or machine learning for the services they provide us and, given that the regulatory framework relating to the use of machine learning and artificial services in the provision of financial services is still developing, the third parties’ use of such technologies may impact their ability to carry out certain functions or impact the quality of their service or performance.\n",

For example, we historically used a third party bank to issue the SoFi Money debit cards and sponsor access to debit networks for payment transactions, funding transactions and associated settlement of funds, and sponsor and support ACH, check and wire transactions along with associated funds settlement. However, after gaining direct access to debit networks, we directly perform certain services previously sponsored by the third party bank. Although we have performed these services satisfactorily to date, there is no guarantee we will be able to continue to do so. Additionally, the migration of any such functions and/or services may introduce additional risks and could cause disruption to our business.\n",

Through contractual provisions and third-party risk management processes, we take steps to require that our providers, and their subcontractors, protect our data and information, including personal data. However, due to the size and complexity of our technology platform and services, the amount of data that we store and the number of members, technology platform clients, employees and third-party service providers with access to personal data, we, our third-party service providers and their subcontractors are potentially vulnerable to a variety of intentional and inadvertent cybersecurity breaches and other security-related incidents and threats, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any contractual protections we may have from our third-party service providers may not be sufficient to adequately protect us against such consequences, and we may be unable to enforce any such contractual protections.\n",
      "In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party service providers or their subcontractors will be able to continue to provide these services to meet our current needs in an efficient, cost-effective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs in the future. Certain of our vendor agreements are terminable on short or no notice, and if current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.

This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes.

Our exposure to the credit risk of the Capped Call Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have, from time to time, resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Capped Call Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that Capped Call Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated with increases in the market price or the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Capped Call Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any Capped Call Counterparty.\n",
      "In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are complex, and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the Capped Call Transactions may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not operate as we intend if we are required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the Capped Call Transactions.\n",

      "In particular, markets in the U.S. or abroad have been and may in the future be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, recessionary pressures, inflation and hyperinflation, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, federal government shutdowns, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, changes in legislation, regulations or policy, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, market volatility, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, exchange rates, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence.

Conversely, significant upturns in the securities markets or in general economic and political conditions may cause individuals to be less proactive in seeking ways to improve the returns on their trading or investment decisions and, thus, decrease the demand for our products and services. Any of these changes could cause our future performance to be uncertain or unpredictable, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a prolonged weakness in the U.S. equity markets or a general extended economic downturn could cause our members or technology platform clients to incur losses, which in turn could cause our brand and reputation to suffer.

      "Our business is sensitive to interest rates and interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including global, domestic and local economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates throughout 2022 and multiple times in 2023, and we are unable to predict whether it will continue to raise rates further. Further changes to prevailing interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans at competitive rates and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; (iii) the average duration of our loan portfolios and other interest-earning assets; (iv) the mix of lending products we originate which is influenced by demand for refinancing products; and (v) the competition faced by our SoFi Money deposit product from other investment products which may become more attractive as interest rates rise. See “Changing expectations for inflation and deflation and corresponding fluctuations in interest rates could decrease demand for our lending products and negatively affect loan performance, as well as increase certain operating costs, such as employee compensation” for additional information on the risks of interest rate fluctuations to our business.\n",
      "Interest rate increases and other actions, including balance sheet management, lending facilities, and the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing, and similar actions taken by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, are beyond our control and difficult to predict. These actions affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments, increase the likelihood of a more volatile market, a further appreciating U.S. dollar and negative growth in gross domestic product, and affect other assets and liabilities and can impact our members and technology platform clients.

For example, changes, or proposed changes, to certain U.S. trade and international investment policies, particularly with important trading partners (including China and the European Union (the “EU”)) have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets. Actions taken by other countries, particularly China, to restrict the activities of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets. An escalation of tensions, such as a further escalation in conflict in the Middle East in connection with the Israel-Hamas war, could lead to further measures that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of duties and tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds. \n",

      "in the recent past combined with longer periods during which we have held, and may continue to hold, loans on-balance sheet. These capital markets risks may be partially mitigated by the availability of bank deposits and other corporate cash (if any) to temporarily hold the loans on our balance sheet. However, bank deposits and corporate cash have not historically been our primary source of funding and can be impacted by a number of factors. Our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets depends, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, lending activities, public perceptions of the financial services industry, and condition of, and our access to, the capital markets at the time we seek financing. The capital markets have recently and from time to time experienced periods of significant volatility, including volatility driven by rising inflation, uncertainty in the financial services sector, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, among other things. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms or make funding unavailable. Additional factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to us include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on our reputation, lawsuits challenging our business practices, adverse regulatory changes, changes in the activities of our business partners, loan performance, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, negative credit rating actions with respect to our rated securities, corporate and regulatory actions, interest rate changes, general economic conditions, including changing expectations for inflation and deflation, and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions, including existing or future securitization transactions. If financing is difficult, expensive or unavailable, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \n",
      "Changing expectations for inflation and deflation and corresponding fluctuations in interest rates could decrease demand for our lending products and negatively affect loan performance, as well as increase certain operating costs, such as employee compensation.\n",
      "There is particular uncertainty about the prospects for growth in the U.S. economy. A number of factors influence the potential economic uncertainty, including, but not limited to, changing U.S. consumer spending patterns, elevated and fluctuating inflation and interest rates, reduced consumer discretionary spending, and weakening wage growth and employment levels. For example, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates throughout 2022 and multiple times in 2023, and we are unable to predict whether it will continue to raise rates further. Increased interest rates may decrease borrower demand for certain of our lending products, even as inflation places pressure on consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits as consumers evaluate their prospects for future income growth and employment opportunities in the current economic environment, and as borrowers face uncertainty about the impact of elevated prices on their ability to repay a loan. A change in demand for our lending products and any steps we may take to mitigate such change could impact our credit quality and overall growth. For example, we have experienced lower demand for our home loans in an elevated interest rate environment, as our historical demand has primarily resulted from refinancing, which is less attractive in a higher interest rate environment. Although demand for refinanced student loans has increased following the expiration of the moratorium on federal student loan payments at the end of August 2023, it has not yet returned to pre-COVID levels. We have also focused on personal loan originations to offset the lower demand in other lending products. Personal loans are a higher risk product than home loans or student loans and we have recently seen an increase in the amount of personal loans that we originate which may increase the inherent risk in our overall portfolio. In addition, fluctuating interest rates may increase our cost of capital and ability to offer a competitive interest rate on our loans. Although we closely monitor these increased risks, there is no guarantee we will make the correct adjustments to our originations or make adjustments quickly enough. Furthermore, economic pressure resulting in the inability of a borrower to repay a loan could translate into increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\n",
      "Additionally, an inflationary environment combined with a healthy labor market and decreases in the market value of our equity awards could make it more costly for us to attract or retain employees. In order to meet the compensation expectations of our prospective and current employees due to inflationary and other factors, we have in the past and may in the future be required to increase our operating costs or risk losing skilled workers to competitors. See “Personnel and Business Continuity Risks—The job market and the optimization of our workforce creates a challenge and potential risk as we strive to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce” for more information on the risks posed by a competitive labor market.\n",
      "Fluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect the demand for our checking and savings product. \n",
      "Falling, low or fluctuating interest rates, which we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future, may have a negative impact on the demand for our checking and savings product. Checking and savings provides members a digital banking experience that offers a variable annual percentage yield, which is at our discretion. If we are not able to offer competitive interest rates on deposit accounts, demand for our checking and savings product may decrease, which may impact our ability to access deposits as a more cost-effective source of funding for our loans. Although we have been in an elevated interest rate environment in recent years, there is no guarantee that it will remain so or that the interest rate we offer on \n",

      "deposit accounts will remain competitive and in a falling or low interest rate environment, account holders and prospective account holders may be discouraged from using these products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\n",
      "Higher than expected payment speeds of loans could negatively impact our returns as the holder of the residual interests in securitization trusts holding personal and student loans. These factors could materially alter our net revenue or the value of our residual interest holdings. \n",
      "The rate at which borrowers prepay their loans can have a material impact on our net revenue and the value of our residual interests in securitization trusts. Prepayment rates are subject to a variety of economic, social, competitive and other factors, including fluctuations in interest rates, availability of alternative financings, legislative, regulatory or policy changes affecting the student loan market, the home loan market, consumer lending generally and the general economy, including changing expectations for inflation and deflation. \n",
      "While we anticipate some variability in prepayment rates, extraordinary or extended increases or decreases in prepayment rates could materially affect our liquidity and net revenue. For example, when, as a result of unanticipated prepayment levels, loans within a securitization trust amortize faster than originally contracted due to prepayments, the trust’s pool balance may decline at a rate faster than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued. If the trust’s pool balance declines faster than originally anticipated, in most of our securitization structures, the bonds issued by that trust will also be repaid faster than originally anticipated. In such cases, our net revenue may decrease, inclusive of our servicing revenue and the diminished value of any retained residual interest by us in the trust. \n",
      "Finally, rating agencies may place bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by a securitization trust, possibly raising or lowering their ratings, based upon these prepayment rates and their perception of the risk posed by those rates to the timing of the trust cash flows. Placing bonds on watch, changing ratings negatively, proposing or making changes to ratings methodology could: (i) affect our liquidity, (ii) impede our access to the securitization markets, (iii) require changes to our securitization structures, and (iv) raise or lower the value of the residual interests of our future securitization transactions. \n",
      "We are exposed to financial risks that may be partially mitigated but cannot be eliminated by our hedging activities, which carry their own risks. \n",
      "We continue to use, and may in the future use, financial instruments for hedging and risk management purposes in order to protect against possible fluctuations in interest rates, or for other reasons that we deem appropriate. In particular, we expect our interest rate risk to increase with our home loans business which continues to grow, including as a result of our acquisition of Wyndham. However, any current and future hedges we enter into will not completely eliminate the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates and our hedging activities may prove to be ineffective. \n",
      "The success of our hedging strategy will be subject to our ability to correctly assess counterparty risk and the degree of correlation between the performance of the instruments used in the hedging strategy and any changes in interest rates, along with our ability to continuously recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, though we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce risks, unanticipated changes may create a more negative consequence than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the instruments being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the effect of the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. Any failure to manage our hedging positions properly or inability to enter into hedging instruments under acceptable terms, or any other unintended or unanticipated economic consequences of our hedging activities, could affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n",

      "We have in the past consummated, and from time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate, acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results. \n",
      "Our success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary assets, businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. For example: (i) in April 2020, we acquired 8 Limited, an investment business in Hong Kong, (ii) in May 2020, we acquired Galileo, a company that provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions, (iii) in February 2022, we acquired Golden Pacific, a bank holding company, (iv) in March 2022, we acquired Technisys, a cloud-native digital multi-product core banking platform, and (v) in April 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a mortgage lender. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include, among others: \n",
      "•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n",
      "•coordination of technology, product development, risk management and sales and marketing functions;\n",
      "•retention of employees from the acquired company and retention of our employees due to cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; \n",
      "•integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources, third-party risk management and other administrative systems; \n",
      "•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, information security and cybersecurity safeguards, procedures and policies, including third-party risk management practices; \n",
      "•write-offs or impairments of intangible assets, goodwill or other assets recognized in connection with the acquisition; \n",
      "•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, including employment laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; \n",
      "•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated or current employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; and \n",
      "•known and unknown regulatory compliance risks resulting from geographic expansion, including elevated risk factors for tax compliance, money laundering controls, and supervisory controls oversight.\n",
      "Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, regulatory obligations to further capitalize our business, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders. To the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. \n",
      "Demand for our products may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological or other changes. \n",

We continue to explore new product offerings and may rely on our proprietary technology to make our platform available to members, to service member accounts, to provide our technology platform as a service to clients and to introduce new products, which both fosters innovation and introduces new potential liabilities and risks. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new types of products, expand our current products into new markets, and continue to streamline our platform. For example, while we do not currently \n",

      "rely heavily on artificial intelligence, we expect to integrate more artificial intelligence into our technology in the future especially to improve the experience of our members. Even if we enhance our current products or release new products that incorporate artificial intelligence, there can be no assurance that our products will be successful or that we will innovate effectively to keep pace with the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior member and technology platform client experience, members’ and clients’ demand for our products may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed. \n",
      "An increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure (including fines and other penalties), and could reduce the use and acceptance of SoFi Money and SoFi Credit Card. \n",
      "Financial institutions like us, as well as our members, colleagues, regulators, vendors and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in fraudulent activity in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated fraudsters and fraud rings in the future. This is particularly true for our newer products where we have limited experience evaluating customer behavior and performing tailored risk assessments, such as checking and savings and credit card. \n",
      "We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security and anti-fraud measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to fraudulent activity, which may affect our results of operations. For example, our general and administrative expenses in the past have included charges related to fraud events. The possibility of fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments, particularly as a large part of our workforce works remotely. Risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the effects of which could be compounded if not detected quickly. Fraudulent activity may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. \n",
      "Fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain a product’s integrity and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation, fines and response costs, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we offer certain fraud and compliance and risk management services to technology platform clients as part of our platform as a service offerings and regulatory scrutiny of these types of services has increased recently. Any failure in these services provided to technology platform clients could result in regulatory actions or fines, and potential loss of client accounts.\n",
      "Successful fraudulent activity and other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain the integrity of our processes and controls could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. \n",
      "SoFi may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of acquiring Technisys.\n",
      "We closed the Technisys acquisition in March 2022 and its operations have been largely integrated into our business. The success of the Technisys acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings and potential additional revenue opportunities, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize various benefits, including, among other things, the development of an end-to-end vertically integrated banking technology stack to support multiple products and enable the combined company to meet the expanding needs of existing customers and serve additional established banks, fintechs and non-financial brands looking to enter financial services. The inability to realize our expected cost savings in connection with the Technisys’ acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, lost cost savings and incremental revenue opportunities and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\n",

Additionally, with the acquisition of Galileo in May 2020, we gained clients in Canada, Mexico and Colombia and, with the acquisition of Technisys in March 2022, we further expanded our operations into Latin America.

      "We operate in a cyclical industry. In an economic downturn, member default rates may increase, there may be decreased demand for our products, and there may be adverse impacts to our business.\n",
      "Recent macroeconomic factors, such as elevated interest rates, global events and market volatility, may cause the economy to enter into a period of slower economic growth or a recession, the length and severity of which cannot be predicted. Such uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions can have a significant negative impact on our ability to generate adequate revenue and to absorb expected and unexpected losses. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may result in higher default rates by our members and non-payment by our technology platform clients, a decline in the demand for our products, and potentially impact our ability to make accurate credit assessments, lending decisions or technology platform client selections. Any of these factors could have a detrimental impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\n",
      "Our Lending and Financial Services segments may be particularly negatively impacted by worsening economic conditions that place financial stress on our members resulting in loan defaults or charge-offs. If a loan charges off while we are still the owner, the loan either enters a collections process or is sold to a third-party collection agency and, in either case, we will receive less than the full outstanding interest on, and principal balance of, the loan. Declining economic conditions may also lead to either decreased demand for our loans or demand for a higher yield on our loans, and consequently lower prices or a lower advance rate, from institutional whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders on whom we rely for liquidity.\n",
      "The longevity and severity of a downturn or recession will also place pressure on lenders under our debt warehouses, whole loan purchasers and investors in our securitizations, each of whom may have less available liquidity to invest in our loans, and long-term market disruptions could negatively impact the securitization market as a whole. Although certain of our \n",

      "\n",
      "debt warehouses contain committed terms, there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will remain available to us through any particular business cycle or be renewed on the same terms. The timing and extent of a downturn may also require us to change, postpone or cancel our strategic initiatives or growth plans to pursue shorter-term sustainability. The longer and more severe an economic downturn, the greater the potential adverse impact on us. \n",
      "Our Technology Platform segment is also susceptible to worsening economic conditions that place financial stress on our current clients using our platform as a service products and services and potential new clients interested in such services. These clients and potential clients may experience liquidity and other financial issues or strategically slowdown growth, any of which could lead them to decrease or terminate their use of our technology platform services or delay or reject implementation of new or expanded products and services. Any such actions with respect to our technology platform products and services could have an adverse impact on our business.\n",
      "There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable for our business, that interest in purchasing our loans by financial institutions or investment by clients in our platform as a service products and services will remain at current levels, or that default rates by our members or instances of non-payment by our technology platform clients will not increase. Reduced demand, lower prices or a lower advance rate for our loan products from institutional whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders, increased default rates by our members, and reduced demand, lower prices and increased non-payment by our technology platform clients, may limit our access to capital, including debt warehouse facilities, securitizations and secured and unsecured borrowing facilities, and negatively impact our profitability. These impacts, in addition to limiting our access to capital and negatively impacting our profitability, could also, in turn, increase the volatility of the mark-to-market methodology we use to determine the fair value of the loans and credit card receivables we hold on balance sheet and consequently have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, capital requirements, liquidity and cash flows.\n",
      "If we do not make accurate credit and pricing decisions or effectively forecast our loss rates, our business and financial results will be harmed, and the harm could be material. \n",
      "In making a decision whether to extend credit to prospective or existing members, we rely upon data to assess our ability to extend credit within our risk appetite, our debt servicing capacity, and overall risk level to determine lending exposure and loan pricing. If the decision components, rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic conditions or analytics are either unstable, biased, or missing key pieces of information, the wrong decisions will be made, which will negatively affect our financial results. If our credit decisioning strategy fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness of our members, including a failure to predict a member’s true credit risk profile and ability to repay their loan or credit card balance, higher than expected loss rates will impact the fair value of our loans and credit card receivables. Additionally, if any portion of the information pertaining to the prospective member is false, inaccurate or incomplete, and our systems did not detect such falsities, inaccuracies or incompleteness, or any or all of the other components of our credit decision process fails, we may experience higher than forecasted losses, including losses attributed to fraud. Furthermore, we rely on credit reporting agencies to obtain credit reports and other information we rely upon in making underwriting and pricing decisions. If one of these third parties experiences an outage, if we are unable to access the third-party data used in our decision strategy, if such data contains inaccuracies or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate potential members will be compromised, and we may be unable to effectively predict credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would negatively impact our results of operations, which could be material. \n",
      "Additionally, if we make errors in the development, validation, or implementation of any of the underwriting models or tools that we use for the loans securing our debt warehouses or included in securitization transactions or whole loan sales, such loans may experience higher delinquencies and losses, which would negatively impact our debt warehouse financing terms and future securitization and whole loan sale transactions. \n",
      "If the information provided to us by applicants is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge an applicant’s qualification to receive a loan or use one of our products, and our results of operations may be harmed. \n",
      "Our lending and platform access decisions are based partly on information provided to us by applicants. To the extent that an applicant provides information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, or the information provided by an applicant consists of data obtained under false pretenses by third parties, is a manufactured/synthetic identity, or is a stolen identity, our credit decisioning process may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources, including credit reporting agencies, is a significant component of our credit decisions and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and results of operations. Additionally, we rely on the accuracy of applicant information in approving applicants for our non-lending products, such as SoFi Money, SoFi Credit Card or SoFi Invest accounts. If the information provided to us by these applicants is incorrect or fraudulent and we are unable to detect the inaccuracies, it increases our \n",

      "regulatory and fraud risk and the risk of identity theft to our members, and could harm our reputation, business and results of operations. \n",
      "We use identity and fraud prevention tools to analyze data provided by external databases or automated physical identity document proofing technologies to authenticate each applicant’s identity. These fraud prevention tools, scores, and data aggregators are reliant on sustained access to reliable data sources to facilitate robust verification which have reduced effectiveness with diminished data access. From time to time in the past, however, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could fail in the future and fraud, which may be significant, may occur and go undetected. For example, in the past we have identified certain fraudulent activity related to our personal loans product. While the fraudulent activity was detected and the losses were recognized in our results of operations, there can be no assurance there will not be future instances of fraud, that we will be able to detect such fraudulent activity in a timely manner, or that such future fraudulent activity will not be material. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, results of operations and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our results of operations, brand and reputation, and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs. \n",
      "Internet-based loan origination processes may give rise to greater risks than paper-based processes. \n",
      "We use internet-based loan processes to obtain application information and distribute certain legally required notices to applicants for, and borrowers of, our loans and to obtain electronically signed loan documents in lieu of paper documents with ink signatures obtained in person. These processes may entail greater risks than paper-based loan origination processes, including regarding the sufficiency of notice for compliance with consumer protection laws, risks that borrowers may challenge the authenticity of loan documents, or the validity of the borrower’s electronic signature on loan documents, and risks that unauthorized changes are made to the electronic loan documents. If any of those factors were to cause our loans, or any of the terms of our loans, to be unenforceable against the relevant borrowers, or impair our ability to service our loans (as master servicer or servicer), the value of our loan assets would decrease significantly to us and to our whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders. In addition to increased default rates and losses on our loans, this could lead to the loss of whole loan purchasers and securitization investors and trigger terminations and amortizations under our debt warehouse facilities, each of which would materially adversely impact our business. \n",
      "Student loans are subject to discharge in certain circumstances. \n",
      "Private education loans, including the refinanced student loans and other student loans made by us, are generally not dischargeable by a borrower in bankruptcy. However, a private education loan may be discharged if a debtor files an adversary claim and the bankruptcy court determines that not discharging the debt would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents. New policies implemented by the Biden Administration in late 2022 gave judges more leeway to discharge student loans, resulting in more borrowers discharging their student loans in bankruptcy in 2023, compared to prior years. In addition, in November 2022, the Department of Justice introduced a new process for handling student loan discharge cases intended to reduce the burden on debtors pursuing discharge of their federal student loans in bankruptcy. Further, bills have been introduced in Congress that would make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy to the same extent as other forms of unsecured credit without regard to a hardship analysis. For example, in October 2022, then House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline introduced the Student Borrower Bankruptcy Relief Act of 2022, which would eliminate the section of the U.S. bankruptcy code that makes private and federal student loans non-dischargeable through bankruptcy. It is possible that a higher percentage of borrowers will obtain relief under bankruptcy or other debtor relief laws in the future than is reflected in our historical experience. A private education loan that is not a refinanced parent-student loan is also generally dischargeable as a result of the death or disability of the borrower. The discharge of a significant amount of our loans could adversely affect our business and results of operations. See “Regulatory, Tax and Other Legal Risks—Legislative and regulatory policies and related actions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our student loan portfolios and our student loan origination volume.”\n",
      "We offer personal loans, which have a limited performance history, and therefore we have only limited prepayment, loss and delinquency data with respect to such loans on which to base projections. \n",
      "The performance of the personal loans we offer is significantly dependent on the ability of the credit decisioning, income validation, and scoring models we use to originate such loans, which include a variety of factors, to effectively evaluate an applicant’s credit profile and likelihood of default. Despite recession-readiness planning and stress forecasting, there is no assurance that our credit criteria can accurately predict loan performance under economic conditions such as a prolonged down-cycle or recessionary economic environment or the governmental response to periods of disruption, which may drive unexpected outcomes. If our criteria do not accurately reflect credit risk on the personal loans, greater than expected losses may \n",

      "result on these loans and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \n",
      "In addition, personal loans are dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a borrower without the need for the borrower to file an adversary proceeding. The discharge of a significant amount of our personal loans could adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, other characteristics of personal loans may increase the risk of default or fraud and there are few restrictions on the uses that may be made of personal loans by borrowers, which may result in increased levels of credit consumption. We also originate a material portion of our personal loans through ACH deposits directly to the borrowers, which may result in a higher risk of fraud. The effect of these factors may be to reduce the amounts collected on our personal loans and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \n",
      "We service all of the personal loans we originate and credit cards we issue and have limited servicing experience, and we rely on third-party service providers to service the student loans and home loans we originate, and to perform various other functions in connection with the origination and servicing of certain of our loans. If we or a third-party service provider fails to properly perform these functions, our business and our ability to service our loans may be adversely affected.\n",
      "We service all of the personal loans we originate and, in all material respects, all of the credit cards we issue, and we have limited experience with such servicing. We may begin servicing the student loans that we originate at some time in the future. We rely on sub-servicers to service all of our student loans and our home loans that we deliver to GSEs and do not sell servicing-released, and to perform certain back-up servicing functions with respect to our personal loans. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers to perform various functions relating to our loan origination and servicing business, including fraud detection, marketing, operational functions, cloud infrastructure services, information technology, telecommunications and processing remotely created checks. While we oversee these service providers to ensure they service our loans in accordance with our agreements and regulatory requirements, we do not have control over the operations of any of the third-party service providers that we utilize. In the event that a third-party service provider for any reason fails to perform such functions, including through negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, our ability to process payments and perform other operational functions for which we currently rely on such third-party service providers will suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted. \n",
      "Any failure on our part or on the part of third parties on whom we rely to perform functions related to our servicing activities to properly service our loans could result in us being removed as the servicer on the loans we originate, including loans financed by our warehouse facilities or sold into our whole loan sales channel and securitization transactions. If we fail to monitor our student loan sub-servicer and ensure that such sub-servicer complies with its obligations under state laws that require student loan servicers to be licensed, we may face civil claims for damages under such state laws. Because we receive revenue from such servicing activities, any such removal as the servicer or, with respect to our student loans, master servicer, could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects, as would the cost of onboarding a new servicer. Furthermore, we have agreed in our servicing agreements to service loans in accordance with the standards set forth therein, and may be obligated to repurchase loans or indemnify the buyer of any such loans if we fail to meet those standards. \n",
      "Additionally, if one or more key third-party service providers were to cease to exist, to become a debtor in a bankruptcy or an insolvency proceeding or to seek relief under any debtor relief laws or to terminate its relationship with us, there could be delays in our ability to process payments and perform other operational functions for which we are currently relying on such third-party service provider, and we may not be able to promptly replace such third-party service provider with a different third-party service provider that has the ability to promptly provide the same services in the same manner and on the same economic terms. As a result of any such delay or inability to replace such key third-party service provider, our ability to process payments and perform other business functions could suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted. \n",
      "We perform and manage the loan origination process for all of the home loans that we originate. If we fail to properly perform these functions, our home loans business may be adversely affected.\n",
      "In April 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a mortgage lender, expanding our home loans business. In connection with the acquisition of Wyndham, we adopted loan origination technology which facilitates performing many functions in connection with the origination of home loans, including processing, underwriting, pricing, vendor management, closing, and additional functions for loan origination that we previously outsourced to third-party providers, and we now directly manage loan underwriters and loan processors which are services previously managed by third-party providers. In the event that we fail for any reason to perform or manage such functions in accordance with all applicable requirements, including through human errors, technology errors, negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, our ability to originate home loans will suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted, and we could incur penalties or liabilities including obligations to repurchase loans from investors to whom we sold the loans. Additionally, if we fail to perform such functions or \n",

      "Potential geographic concentration of our members may increase the risk of loss on the loans that we originate and negatively impact our business. \n",
      "Any concentration of our members in specific geographic areas may increase the risk of loss on our loans. Certain regions of the U.S. from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions and higher unemployment and, consequently, will experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar loans in other regions of the country. Moreover, a further deterioration in economic conditions or a recession, outbreaks of disease (such as additional COVID-19 strains or variants), the continued increase in extreme weather conditions and other natural events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, drought, wildfires, mudslides, earthquakes and other extreme conditions) and other factors could adversely affect the ability and willingness of borrowers in affected regions to meet their payment obligations under their loans and may consequently affect the delinquency and loss experience of such loans. In addition, we, as master servicer for all student loans and home loans and as servicer of our personal loans, have offered in the past, and may in the future offer, hardship forbearance or other relief programs in certain circumstances to affected borrowers. \n",
      "Conversely, an improvement in economic conditions in one or more of the geographic areas in which we have members could result in higher prepayments of their payment obligations under their loans by borrowers in such states. As a result, we and the whole loan purchasers who hold our loans or securitization investors or warehouse lenders who hold securities backed by our loans may receive principal payments earlier than anticipated, and fewer interest payments than anticipated, and face certain reinvestment risks, such as the inability to acquire loans on equally attractive terms as the prepaid loans. In addition, higher prepayments than anticipated may have a negative impact on our servicing revenue which could cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected.\n",
      "Further, the concentration of our loans in one or more geographic locations may have a disproportionate effect on us or investors in our loans or securities backed by our loans if governmental authorities in any of those areas take action against us as originator, master servicer or servicer of those loans or take action affecting our ability as master servicer or servicer to service those loans.\n",

      "\n",
      "If we are unable to retain and/or increase our current sources of funding, including deposits, and secure new or alternative methods of financing, our ability to finance additional loans and introduce new products will be negatively impacted. \n",
      "Historically, in addition to the issuance of equity, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through access to the capital markets through sales of our loans, access to secured and unsecured borrowing facilities and utilization of securitization financing from consolidated and nonconsolidated VIEs. In each of these instances (other than for certain whole loan sales of home loans), we retain the servicing rights to our loans from which we earn a servicing fee. In securitization financing transactions, we transfer a pool of loans originated by SoFi Lending Corp. or SoFi Bank to a VIE which is sponsored by SoFi Lending Corp. or SoFi Bank, and we retain risk in the VIE, typically in the form of asset-backed bonds and residual interest investments. Through SoFi Bank, we utilize deposits as well, which offer us a lower cost source of funds, and we have the ability to access other funding sources, such as the FHLB and certain brokered deposit channels established by SoFi Bank. We rely on each of these outlets for liquidity and the loss or reduction of any one of these outlets, including deposits, could materially adversely impact our business. For example, certain banks have faced operational difficulties in accessing the FHLB discount window and there is no guarantee that we will not face the same or similar issues. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access the securitization markets at any given time, or that deposits at SoFi Bank will remain at current levels or grow, and in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking and financial system, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments, an increase in the amount of equity we are required to hold or the liquidation of certain assets. Furthermore, there is a risk that there will be no market at all for our loans either from whole loan buyers or through investments in securities backed by our loans. \n",
      "We may require capital in excess of amounts we currently anticipate, and depending on market conditions and other factors, we may not be able to maintain our capital or obtain additional capital for our current operations or anticipated future growth on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we originate, and the increased suite of products that we make available to members, increases, we may be required to expand the size of our debt warehousing facilities or seek additional sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are outside of our \n",

      "If we are unable to increase our current sources of funding, including deposits, and secure new or alternative methods of financing, our ability to finance additional loans and to develop and offer new products will be negatively impacted. The interest rates, advance rates and other costs of new, renewed or amended facilities may also be higher than those currently in effect. If we are unable to renew or otherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may be forced to curtail our origination of loans or reduce lending or other operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n",
      "If one or more of our warehouse facilities, on which we are highly dependent, is terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n",
      "We require a significant amount of short-term funding capacity for loans we originate. Consistent with industry practice, our existing warehouse facilities generally require periodic renewal. If any of our committed warehouse facilities are terminated or are not renewed or our uncommitted facilities are not honored, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, and we might not be able to originate an acceptable or sustainable volume of loans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, as our business continues to expand, including our home loan business, we may need additional warehouse funding capacity for the loans we originate. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain additional warehouse funding capacity on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. \n",
      "If we fail to meet or satisfy any of the financial or other covenants included in our warehouse facilities, we would be in default under one or more of these facilities and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against loans pledged under such facilities and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. Certain of these facilities also contain cross-default provisions. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities, which could materially and adversely affect us. There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with all financial and other covenants included in our warehouse facilities in the future.\n",
      "In addition, our agreements with our warehouse lenders contain various concentration limits and triggers, including related to excess spread. As high interest rates place pressure on our net cost of funds for loans held at SoFi Lending Corp., which do not benefit from deposit funding through SoFi Bank, the likelihood of reaching an excess spread limit increases. A breach of such limits or other similar terms of such agreements could result in an inability to place loans in the relevant warehouse facilities and require us to pursue other forms of financing. If we are unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, our operations could be impacted materially.\n",
      "Increases in member default rates on loans could make us and our loans less attractive to whole loan buyers, lenders under debt warehouse facilities and investors in securitizations, which may adversely affect our access to financing and our business. \n",
      "Increases in member default rates, due to deteriorating economic conditions or other factors, could make us and our loans less attractive to our existing or prospective funding sources, including whole loan buyers, securitization investors and lenders under debt warehousing facilities. If our existing funding sources do not achieve their desired financial returns or if they suffer losses, they or prospective funding sources may increase the cost of providing future financing or refuse to provide future financing or purchase loans on terms acceptable to us or at all. \n",
      "Our securitizations are nonrecourse to the Company and are collateralized by the pool of our loans pledged to the relevant securitization issuer. If the loans securing our securitizations fail to perform as expected, rating agencies may place our bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by our securitization trusts. Our loans performance and any actions taken by the rating agencies could result in the lenders under our warehouse facilities, the whole loan purchasers who purchase our loans, the investors in our securitizations who purchase securities backed by our loans, or future lenders, whole loan purchasers or securitization investors in similar arrangements, increasing the cost of providing future financing or refusing to provide future financing or purchase loans on terms acceptable to us or at all. \n",
      "While this risk may be partially mitigated by our ability to hold loans on our balance sheet, in sufficient volume this will negatively impact our financial condition. Consequently, if we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail or cease our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n",

      "We make representations and warranties in connection with the transfer of loans to whole loan purchasers, government-sponsored enterprises, and our debt warehouse lenders and securitization trusts. If such representations and warranties are not correct, we could be required to repurchase loans or indemnify the purchaser, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and fund our business. \n",
      "We sell and finance the loans we originate to and with third parties, including, with respect to home loans, counterparties like GSEs, and we make certain representations and warranties to those third parties in connection with the transfer of loans described below. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to liability under these representations and warranties made to purchasers of loans. Such representations and warranties typically include, among other things, that the loans were originated and serviced in compliance with the law and with our credit risk origination policy and servicing guidelines, and, in connection with transfers to GSEs, that the loans were originated in compliance with the guidelines of the relevant GSE, and that, to the best of our knowledge, each loan was originated by us without any fraud or misrepresentation on our part or on the part of the borrower or any other person. In addition, purchasers require loans to meet strict underwriting and loan term criteria in order to be eligible for purchase. If those representations and warranties are breached as to a given loan, or if a certain loan we sell does not meet the relevant eligibility criteria, we will be obligated to repurchase the loan, typically at a purchase price equal to the then-outstanding principal balance of such loan, plus accrued interest and any premium. We may also be required to indemnify the purchaser for losses resulting from the breach of representations and warranties. With regard to home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or the VA, and to the extent that any of our home loans do not comply with Federal Housing Administration or VA guidelines, we could also face claims under the False Claims Act. In connection with our whole loan sales, we also typically covenant to repurchase any loan that enters delinquent status within the first thirty to sixty days following origination of the loan. Any significant increase in our obligation to repurchase loans or indemnify purchasers of loans could have a significant adverse impact on our cash flows, even if they are reimbursable, and could also have a detrimental effect on our business and financial condition. If any such repurchase event occurs on a large scale, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our repurchase obligations, which would result in a default under the underlying agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to resell or refinance loans repurchased due to a breach of a representation or warranty or we may be forced to sell such loans below par. Any such event could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, in the acquisition of Wyndham, we also acquired Wyndham's liability to its loan investors and loan insurers for mortgage loans originated by Wyndham, including repurchase obligations that might not be contingent upon the investor proving an error by Wyndham.\n",
      "In addition to loan level representations and warranties, our agreements with the lenders and investors on our securitizations, debt warehouse facilities and corporate revolving debt contain a number of corporate financial covenants and early payment triggers and performance covenants. These facilities, together with deposits, are the primary funding sources available to support the maintenance and growth of our business and our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by our inability to comply with the various covenants and other specified requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders and investors, which could result in the early amortization, default and/or acceleration of our existing facilities. Such covenants and requirements include financial covenants, portfolio performance covenants and other events. For a description of these covenants, requirements and events, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”. \n",
      "During an early amortization period or occurrence of a termination event or an event of default, principal collections from the loans in our warehouse facilities would be applied to repay principal under such facilities rather than being available to fund newly originated loans. During the occurrence of a termination event or an event of default under any of our facilities, the applicable lenders could accelerate the related debt and such lenders’ commitments to extend further credit under the related facility, if any, would terminate. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such facilities and securitizations, the applicable lenders and noteholders could seek remedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities and by the securitization trust. An acceleration of the debt under certain facilities could also lead to a default under other facilities and, in certain instances, our hedging arrangements, due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. \n",
      "An early amortization event or event of default would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loans, and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or which might not be available when needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to hold loans on balance sheet in an amount that may negatively impact our financial condition, or curtail or cease the origination of loans, which could impair our growth, and, in each case, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under our facilities. \n",

      "We require substantial capital and, in the future, may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and achieve recurring profitability. If adequate capital is not available to us or is unavailable on favorable terms, including due to the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. \n",
      "Since our founding, we have raised substantial equity and debt financing to support the growth of our business. We may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and growth strategy and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including supporting our lending operations, increasing our marketing expenditures to attract new members and technology platform clients and improve our brand awareness, developing our products, introducing new services, further expanding internationally in existing or new countries or further improving existing offerings and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and potentially acquiring complementary businesses and technologies, and complying with the increased regulatory requirements for bank holding companies and banks. Accordingly, on a regular basis we need, or we may need, to engage in additional debt or equity financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, in amounts we need, or permitted to be applied to specific use cases, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Volatility in the credit markets in general or in the market for personal, student and home loans and credit cards in particular may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Furthermore, the cost of our borrowing has increased and may continue to increase due to market volatility, interest rates that are higher than those in the recent past, changes in the risk premiums required by lenders or the unavailability of traditional sources of debt capital. Volatility or depressed valuations or trading prices in the equity markets may similarly adversely affect our ability to obtain equity financing. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. \n",
      "We are required to serve as a source of financial strength for SoFi Bank, which is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulators, which means that we may be required to provide capital or liquidity support to SoFi Bank, even at times when we may not have the resources to provide such support. In addition, maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our securities brokerage, including key functions such as transaction settlement, custody requirements and margin lending. Our broker-dealer subsidiary, SoFi Securities, is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, which specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers, and SoFi Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act, which requires broker-dealers to maintain certain liquidity reserves. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital, deposits and cash generated by member activity, as well as from external debt and equity financing. Increases in the number of members, fluctuations in member cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of member deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. \n",
      "A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce our members’ confidence in us, which could result in the withdrawal of member assets, including deposits held at SoFi Bank, and loss of members, or could cause us to fail to satisfy minimum capital requirements for SoFi Bank, or broker-dealer or other regulatory capital guidelines, which may result in immediate suspension of banking and other securities activities, regulatory prohibitions against certain business practices, increased regulatory inquiries and reporting requirements, increased costs, fines, penalties or other sanctions, by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the SEC, FINRA or other SROs or state regulators, and could ultimately lead to the liquidation of SoFi Bank or our broker-dealer or other regulated entities. Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in member accounts, a significant increase in our margin lending activities, increased regulatory capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, or Federal Housing Administration or VA guidelines, other regulatory changes or a loss of market or member confidence resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of member assets. We expect that we will continue to use our available cash to fund our lending activities and help scale our Financial Services segment. To supplement our cash resources, we may seek to enter into additional securitizations and whole loan sale agreements or increase the size of existing debt warehousing facilities, increase the size of, or replace, our revolving credit facility, continue to grow deposits and pursue other potential options. In addition, a reduction in our liquidity position could impair our technology platform clients’ confidence in us and our platform as a service products and services, many of which require capital investments and ongoing platform maintenance by us, which could result in decisions by our technology platform clients to terminate or not renew their existing contracts or to not add new products to their account.\n",
      "If we are unable to adequately maintain our cash resources, we may delay non-essential capital expenditures, implement cost cutting procedures, delay or reduce future hiring, discontinue the pursuit of our strategic objectives and growth strategies or reduce our rate of future originations compared to the current level.

      "We have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model, the success of which is tied to our ability to finance the assets that we originate. Certain of our assets, however, are ineligible for sale to a whole loan buyer or securitization trust, or are ineligible for, or are subject to a lower advance rate under, warehouse funding, each of which has specific eligibility criteria for receivables it purchases or holds as collateral. Ineligible receivables include, among others, those in default or that are delinquent, receivables with defects in their origination or servicing, including fraud, or receivables generated under origination guidelines and credit policies that are no longer in effect. In addition, many of our warehouse funding sources contain excess concentration limits for loans in forbearance or with specific loan level characteristics such as time-to-maturity or loan type. Once these limits have been exceeded, the advance rate applied to those receivables becomes less advantageous to us. If we are unable to sell or reasonably fund these receivables, we are required to hold them on our consolidated balance sheet which, in sufficient volume, negatively impacts our financial condition. \n",
      "In addition to the receivables described above, we also hold on our consolidated balance sheet certain risk retention assets with respect to which we have a reduced ability to receive financing. These risk retention assets include residuals from our securitization trusts that are either ineligible for transfer or are subject to EU regulations. The illiquidity of these positions may negatively impact our financial condition. \n",
      "Our checking and savings product is expected to continue to provide us with an important source of cost-efficient funding and any failure to scale the product due to our limited experience or a competitive marketplace could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \n",
      "We expect that checking and savings, a deposit account product, will continue to provide us with an important source of deposits to use for cost-effective funding of loan originations and other activities. However, revenue growth for checking and savings is dependent on increasing the volume of members who open an account and on growing balances in those accounts. Although checking and savings accounts have grown since its introduction in the first quarter of 2022, there is no guarantee that account openings and the amount on deposit in those accounts will continue to grow. In addition, although we have invested in a number of initiatives to attract new checking and savings account holders and capture a greater share of our members’ savings, including offering a competitive annual percentage yield on deposits and offering SoFi Plus membership benefits to deposit holders, there can be no assurance that these investments to acquire and retain members, provide differentiated features and services and spur usage of our deposit account product will be effective or cost effective. There are also no assurances that we will be able to maintain a competitive annual percentage yield on deposits, and members can easily transfer checking and savings account balances to our competitors. Further, developing our service offerings and marketing the checking and savings product in additional customer acquisition channels could have higher costs than anticipated or be less effective than anticipated, and could adversely impact our results or dilute our brand. Finally, our checking and savings product faces competition from similar products offered by our competitors which may offer more attractive features, including a higher interest rate on deposits, which may impact the success of the product. In the event we are unable to sufficiently grow the checking and savings product, we may be required to find alternative, higher-cost funding for our lending and other activities, or we might not be able to originate an acceptable or sustainable volume of loans, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.

      "As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, and SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC, as well as regulations issued by the CFPB. Federal laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The OCC possesses the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. In general, the bank supervisory framework is intended to protect insured depositors and the safety, soundness and stability of the U.S. financial system and not shareholders in depository institutions or their holding companies.\n",
      "In connection with applying for approval to become a bank holding company, we developed a financial and bank capitalization plan and enhanced our governance, compliance, controls and management infrastructure and capabilities in order to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, which required, and will continue to require, substantial time, monetary and human resource commitments. If any new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations to which we are subject impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, our financial performance, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.\n",
      "Federal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define “capital” for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the capital conservation buffer amount. The federal banking regulators could also require the Company and/or SoFi Bank, as applicable, to hold capital that exceeds minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions. The application of these capital requirements could, among other things, require us to maintain higher capital resulting in lower returns on equity, and we may be required to obtain additional capital, or face regulatory actions if we are unable, to comply with such requirements.\n",
      "We are also subject to the requirements in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing Regulation W, which regulate loans, extensions of credit, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between an insured depository institution (such as SoFi Bank) and its affiliates. The statute and regulation require us to impose certain quantitative limits, collateral requirements and other restrictions on “covered transactions” between SoFi Bank and its affiliates and require all transactions be on “market terms” and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices.\n",
      "The laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change, including increased regulation as a result of the turmoil in the banking industry. These changes could adversely and materially impact us. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal banking laws subject companies with $10 billion or more of consolidated assets to additional regulatory requirements.

SoFi Bank is required to comply with the restrictions on interchange fees that went into effect on July 1, 2023, which may negatively impact future interchange fees we collect. In addition, in October 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to the regulations implementing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act that would further restrict the amount of interchange fees that may be charged and require biennial reviews of those fees. Changes in laws, rules, regulations and supervisory guidance and policies could, among other things, subject us to additional costs, including costs of compliance; limit the types of financial services and products we may offer; and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal and state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter or registration as a broker-dealer and investment adviser, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n",
      "Finally, we intend to continue to explore other products for SoFi Bank over time. Some of those products may require, or be deemed to require, additional data, procedures, partnerships, regulatory approvals, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed.

Such actions could be public or of a confidential nature, and arise even if we are acting in good faith or operating under a reasonable interpretation of the law and could include, for example, monetary penalties, payment of damages or other monetary relief, restitution or disgorgement of profits, directives to take remedial action or to cease or modify practices, restrictions on growth or expansionary proposals, denial or refusal to accept applications, removal of officers or directors, prohibition on dividends or capital distributions, increases in capital or liquidity requirements and/or termination of SoFi Bank’s deposit insurance. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws, regulations and commitments requires significant investment of management attention and resources. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\n",
      "SoFi Bank accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. Although we launched the SoFi Insured Deposit Program in 2023, whereby funds (up to $2 million) are deposited into deposit accounts at banks which are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, we continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\n",
      "Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on SoFi Bank’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. For example, while SoFi Bank met the definition of “well-capitalized” as of December 31, 2023 and currently has no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet this definition. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses.

      "•permit private education loans such as our refinanced student loan and in-school student loan products to be discharged in bankruptcy without the need to show undue hardship; \n",
      "•amend the federal postsecondary education loan programs, including to reduce interest rates on certain loans, to revise repayment plans, to make income-driven repayment plans more attractive to borrowers, to implement broader loan forgiveness plans, to provide for refinancing of private education loans into federal student loans at low interest rates, to reduce or eliminate the Grad PLUS program (which authorizes loans that comprise a substantial portion of our student loan refinancing business) and to provide for refinancing of existing federally held student loans into new federal student loans at low interest rates; \n",
      "•require private education lenders to reform loan agreements to provide for income-driven repayment plans and other payment plans; and\n",
      "•make sweeping changes to the entire cost structure and financial aid system for higher education in the U.S., including proposals to provide free postsecondary education.\n",
      "In addition, there is pressure on policymakers to reduce or cancel student loans or accrued interest at a significant scale, which would further reduce demand for our student loan refinancing product and have a negative impact on our loan origination volume and revenue. For example, despite legal challenges at the Supreme Court to some of the Biden Administration’s prior student loan forgiveness measures, the Biden Administration continues to pursue options for providing relief to student borrowers, announcing additional relief in June 2023 and January 2024. In June 2023, the Biden administration announced that it would cancel more than $132 billion of student debt for more than three million borrowers and continue to pursue debt forgiveness strategies including through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan which offers forgiveness after as few as 10 years of payments for borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less for college. In January 2024, the Biden administration announced that it will implement that plan beginning in February 2024, including by automatically canceling loans for certain eligible borrowers.\n",
      "The future impact to our student loan refinancing product will largely depend on expectations regarding the introduction or implementation of these or any additional relief measures, the interest rate environment, how competitive our student loan refinancing products are compared to our competitors and macroeconomic factors. If in the future, student loans were forgiven or canceled in any meaningful scale, or if federal loan borrowers were permitted to refinance at lower interest rates, our student loan refinancing business within our Lending segment, which is our largest segment, would be materially and adversely affected and our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result. In addition, proposals to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy or similar proposals could make whole loan purchasers less likely to purchase our student loans, securitization investors less likely to purchase securities backed by our student loans or warehouse lenders less likely to lend against our student loans at attractive advance rates. As a result of any material adverse effect to our Lending segment, our overall profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects may be adversely affected.\n",
      "Although we continue to evaluate the ultimate impact of local, state and federal legislation, regulation and politics, guidance and actions, future legislative, regulatory and executive actions, and the ongoing impact of our own forbearance measures on our financial results, business operations and strategies, there is no guarantee that our estimates will be accurate or that any actions we take based on such estimates will be successful. Furthermore, we believe that the cost of responding to, and complying with, evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as will the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on our businesses. Our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.\n",
      "If we fail to comply with federal and state consumer protection laws, rules, regulations and guidance, our business could be adversely affected.\n",
      "The CFPB, an agency which oversees compliance with and enforces federal consumer financial protection laws, has supervisory authority over the offer, sale or provision of our consumer financial products and services. Prior to January 1, 2024, \n",

      "the OCC examined SoFi Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforced CFPB rules with respect to SoFi Bank. In addition, to the extent certain of our lending or loan servicing activity was conducted outside of SoFi Bank, the CFPB had the authority to pursue enforcement actions against us as a company offering those certain consumer financial products or services. Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of UDAAP in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB may seek a range of remedies, including rescission of contracts, refund of money, return of real property, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other compensation for unjust enrichment, damages, public notification of the violation and “conduct” restrictions (i.e., future limits on the target’s activities or functions). Under the current administration and leadership of the agency, the CFPB has pursued a more aggressive enforcement policy with respect to a range of regulatory compliance matters. For example, on January 6, 2022, the CFPB announced a new initiative to scrutinize so-called consumer “junk fees.” Since then, the CFPB has taken action to constrain “pay-to-pay” fees and has announced a rulemaking proceeding on credit card late fees. On October 26, 2022, the CFPB issued guidance to banks on how to avoid charging unlawful overdraft and depositor fees. On February 1, 2023, the CFPB proposed a rule to curb credit card late fees, including proposing an $8 immunity provision to any missed payment. On March 16, 2023, the CFPB issued a bulletin on unfair billing and collection practices after bankruptcy discharges of certain student loan debt, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, to notify regulated entities how the CFPB intends to exercise its enforcement and supervisory authorities on this issue. On July 13, 2023, the CFPB sued Prehired for illegal student lending practices, including misrepresenting the nature of its loans, tricking consumers in its debt collection practices, and suing students in faraway jurisdictions. In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring certain civil actions. Increased enforcement or rules from the CFPB could increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources.\n",
      "We hold lending licenses or similar authorizations in multiple states, each of which has the authority to supervise and examine our activities. As a licensed consumer lender, mortgage lender, loan broker, collection agency, MSB and loan servicer in certain states, we are subject to examinations by state agencies in those states. Similarly, we are subject to licensure requirements and regulations as an education loan servicer in multiple states. An administrative proceeding, litigation, investigation or regulatory proceeding relating to allegations or findings of the violation of such laws by us, any sub-servicer we engage, or our collection agents, could impair our ability to service and collect on our loans or could result in requirements that we pay damages, fines or penalties and/or cancel the balance or other amounts owing under one or more of our loans. There is no assurance that allegations of violations of the provisions of applicable federal or state consumer protection laws will not be asserted against us, any sub-servicers or collection agents we engage or other prior owners of our loans in the future. To the extent it is determined that any of our loans were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we may be obligated to repurchase such loan from a whole loan buyer, securitization trust or warehouse facility. \n",

Privacy and data security concerns, data collection and transfer restrictions, contractual obligations and U.S. laws and regulations related to data privacy, security and protection could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

      "The CRA, to which SoFi Bank is subject, presents a useful example of how a failure to comply with applicable laws could hamper our growth. On January 1, 2023, SoFi Bank began operating under a five-year CRA strategic plan which includes measurable goals relating to: (i) CD Lending and CD Investments, (ii) CD Contributions, (iii) CD Services, (iv) Small Business Lending, and (v) Retail Services and Products. On October 23, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC approved changes to their CRA regulations, maintaining the existing CRA ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Noncompliance) but modifying the evaluation framework to replace the existing tests generally applicable to banks with at least $2 billion in assets (the lending, investment, and services tests) with four new tests and associated performance metrics. The new CRA regulations, which become effective on January 1, 2026, increase the geographic areas in which banks will be evaluated for CRA performance and may be particularly burdensome on banks focused on mobile and digital banking such as SoFi Bank. The OCC’s assessment of our compliance with the CRA is taken into account when evaluating any application we submit for, among other things, a merger or the acquisition of another financial institution. Our failure to satisfy our CRA obligations could, at a minimum, result in the denial of such applications and limit our growth.\n",
      "In the first quarter of 2019, we were subject to a consent order from the FTC (the “FTC Consent Order”), which resolved allegations that we misrepresented how much money student loan borrowers have saved or would save from financing their loans with us, in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under the FTC Consent Order, we are prohibited from misrepresenting to consumers how much money they would save by using our products, unless the claims are backed up by reliable evidence.\n",
      "While we have developed and monitor policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that our compliance policies and procedures will be effective and that we will not be subject to fines and penalties, including with respect to any alleged noncompliance with the FTC Consent Order. Ambiguities in applicable statutes and regulations may leave uncertainty with respect to permitted or restricted conduct and may make compliance with laws, and risk assessment decisions with respect to compliance with laws, difficult and uncertain. In addition, ambiguities make it difficult, in certain circumstances, to determine if, and how compliance violations may be cured. We have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with applicable statutes and regulations even if acting in good faith, or because governmental bodies or courts interpret existing laws or regulations in a more restrictive manner, which have in the past and may in the future lead to regulatory investigations, governmental enforcement actions or private causes of action with respect to our compliance. To resolve issues raised in examinations or other governmental actions, we may be required to take various corrective actions, including changing certain business practices, making refunds or taking other actions that could be financially or competitively detrimental to us. In some cases, regardless of fault, it may be less time-consuming or costly to settle these matters, which may require us to implement certain changes to our business practices, provide remediation to certain individuals or make a settlement payment to a given party or regulatory body. There is no assurance that any future settlements will not have a material adverse effect on our business. \n",
      "We hold state licenses that result in substantial compliance costs, and our business would be adversely affected if our licenses are impaired as a result of noncompliance with those requirements. \n",
      "We currently hold state licenses in connection with our lending activities, our student loan servicing activities, our securities business as well as our prior MSB activities. Although we have transitioned our lending products to SoFi Bank, for as long as SoFi Lending Corp. originates, purchases or master services or services loans, we must comply with certain state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements. In addition. although we have transferred our digital assets business, we still hold MSB licenses while we determine whether to maintain or relinquish those licenses. Changes in licensing laws may result in increased disclosure requirements, increased fees, or may impose other conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency or agencies regulate and enforce laws relating to loan servicers, brokers, and originators, collection agencies, and MSBs. We are subject to periodic examinations by state and other regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, which can result in increases in our administrative costs and refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by those regulators due to compliance errors, or we may lose our license or our ability to do business in the jurisdiction otherwise may be impaired. Fines and penalties incurred in one jurisdiction may cause investigations or other actions by regulators in other jurisdictions. \n",
      "We may not be able to maintain all currently required licenses and permits. If we change or expand our business activities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses before we can engage in those activities. If we apply for a new license, a regulator may determine that we were required to do so at an earlier point in time, and as a result, may impose penalties or refuse to issue the license, which could require us to modify or limit our activities in the relevant state.

      "example, we have been fined in the past by state regulators for engaging in financial services related activities prior to obtaining a license. Based on changes to our businesses, we may also forfeit certain of our licenses that are no longer required, such as our MSB licenses following the transfer of our digital assets business. Regulators may impose conditions, requirements or penalties in connection with the forfeiture of any of our licenses.\n",
      "States may also expand or otherwise modify their current regulations and if such states so act, we may not be able to comply with such updated regulations or maintain all requisite licenses and permits in such states or our costs of compliance with and maintenance of such licenses or permits may materially increase. For example, California, Colorado and Maine have implemented additional regulations related to student loan servicers which impose additional registration, reporting and disclosure requirements and which, if applicable to us, may increase our costs of originating and servicing loans in those states.\n",
      "In addition, the states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our business may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits, which could require us to modify or limit our activities in the relevant state or states. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our warehouse facilities, other financial arrangements and/or servicing agreements and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n",
      "Our compliance and risk management policies and procedures as a bank, bank holding company and otherwise regulated financial services company may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating compliance and risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\n",
      "As a bank, a bank holding company and a financial services company operating in the banking and securities industry, among others, our business exposes us to a number of heightened risks. We have devoted significant resources to developing our compliance and risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so, but there can be no assurance these are sufficient, especially as our business is rapidly growing and evolving. Nonetheless, our limited operating history in many of the products we offer, our evolving business and our rapid growth make it difficult to predict all of the risks and challenges we may encounter and may increase the risk that our policies and procedures that serve to identify, monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Further, some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations and errors in oversight. This could cause our compliance and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other compliance and risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, catastrophic occurrences or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. Any failure to maintain effective compliance and other risk management strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "We are also exposed to heightened regulatory risk because our business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, and such regulations are subject to evolving interpretations and application and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. Additionally, the regulatory landscape involving digital assets is constantly evolving. Although we have exited our digital assets business, the Company, including SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, may still be subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our prior business practices.\n",
      "Also, due to market volatility, it is difficult to predict how much capital we will need in the future to meet net capital requirements. Any perceived or actual breach of laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is possible that these laws and regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter or impair our existing or planned products and services. \n",
      "Regulatory scrutiny of banking as a service, or BaaS, solutions has recently increased and may require us to devote significant resources to enhancing our Technology Platform policies, procedures, operations, controls and products, and the failure to satisfy such increased scrutiny may cause regulators to take action against us or our BaaS partners, or result in a loss of one or more of our BaaS partners.\n",
      "Our Technology Platform facilitates the provision of BaaS products and services to third parties through various card, deposit, payment, transfer, credit and lending solutions that allow financial technology companies or other third parties to, among other things, connect to sponsor banks’ systems directly via application programming interfaces and cloud infrastructure so they can build banking offerings on top of the sponsor banks’ regulated infrastructure. In addition, our Technology Platform offers an end-to-end core banking platform solution with integrated payment processing. Furthermore, in connection with our Technology Platform's BaaS solutions, we sometimes offer certain program management, data, analytics, compliance and risk \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "management functions. The third parties that use these BaaS solutions include a variety of financial entities, including banks, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries. SoFi Bank is one of the sponsor banks that utilizes our BaaS products and services and may continue to do so in the future.\n",
      "Federal bank regulators have increasingly focused on the risks related to BaaS solutions, including risk management, oversight, internal controls, information security, change management and information technology operational resilience, as well as potential systemic risk posed by BaaS solutions to the larger banking industry. Recently, regulators have even brought enforcement actions against financial entities that have allegedly not adequately addressed these concerns while growing their BaaS offerings. Regulators have specifically required these financial entities to enhance oversight of third-party fintech partnerships, improve control frameworks related to anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance, and adopt, implement and adhere to revised and expanded risk-based policies, procedures and processes. If we or any of the fintech clients or sponsor bank partners supported by our Technology Platform were to face regulatory actions that limit the growth of our or their fintech business, or if we were forced to stop growing our Technology Platform, or if any of our fintech clients or sponsor banks were to limit or cease their participation in BaaS solutions, this could have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operation for the Technology Platform segment.\n",
      "Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny of BaaS solutions extends directly to middleware providers, such as our Technology Platform, which, in certain circumstances, bear accountability for their partners’ compliance and risk management, including with respect to penalties, fines, and other measures that bank regulatory agencies take in the event of non-compliant activity or risks that are not well controlled. This is particularly true when the BaaS solution includes program management, and compliance and risk management controls, including managing anti-money laundering and fraud risks. In addition, as our fintech and sponsor bank partners face increased regulatory scrutiny, their scrutiny of our services will likely increase and our inability to satisfactorily respond to partner demands could result in those partners moving to different solutions. Assessing and managing risk for our Technology Platform clients in the face of regulatory and client scrutiny has in the past and will continue to require us to devote significant resources to enhancing relevant policies, procedures, operations and products. Finally, as a subsidiary of a bank holding company, any failure of our Technology Platform's BaaS solutions to withstand regulatory scrutiny could reflect badly on our relationship with our regulators and on our overall reputation.\n",
      "While we believe we are a leader in managing, monitoring and overseeing BaaS relationships with third parties and corresponding technologies, if we are not successful in continuing to enhance our controls for assessing and managing the third-party, anti-money laundering, fraud and information technology risks stemming from certain of our fintech and sponsor bank partnerships, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny with respect to that portion of our business which could subject us to regulatory fines or other penalties, or business or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "We may become subject to enforcement actions or litigation as a result of our failure to comply with laws and regulations, even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional. \n",
      "We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. \n",
      "For example, we engage in outbound telephone and text communications with consumers, and accordingly must comply with a number of federal and state statutes and regulations that regulate certain such communications, including the TCPA and Telemarketing Sales Rules. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), and the FTC have responsibility for regulating various aspects of some of these federal laws. Among other requirements, the TCPA requires us to obtain prior express written consent for certain telemarketing calls and to adhere to “do-not-call” registry requirements which, in part, mandate we maintain and regularly update lists of consumers who have chosen not to be called and restrict calls to consumers who are on the national do-not-call list. In addition, in December 2023, the FCC introduced new regulations under the TCPA addressing lead generator relationships, among other things. Florida and several other states also have mini-TCPA and other similar consumer protection laws regulating certain telemarketing directed to their residents. These federal and state laws limit our ability to communicate with consumers and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing programs. As currently construed, the TCPA does not distinguish between voice and data, and, as such, SMS/MMS messages are also “calls” for the purpose of TCPA obligations and restrictions. \n",
      "For violations of the TCPA, the law provides for a private right of action under which a plaintiff may recover monetary statutory damages of $500 for each call or text made in violation of the statute. A court may treble the $500 amount upon a finding of a willful or knowing violation. There is no statutory cap on maximum aggregate exposure for TCPA violations (although some courts have applied in TCPA class actions constitutional limits on excessive penalties). Like the TCPA, several \n",

      "\n",
      "mini-TCPA and other similar state laws also provide for a private right of action under which a plaintiff may recover statutory damages of $500 or more for each violative call or text and enhanced statutory if the violation is knowing or willful. An action may be brought by the FCC, a state attorney general, an individual, or a class of individuals. Like other companies that rely on telephone and text communications, we may be subject to putative class action suits alleging violations of the TCPA, and state mini-TCPA and other similar state laws. If in the future we are found to have violated any federal or state law regulating telemarketing, the amount of damages and potential liability could be extensive and adversely impact our business.\n",
      "In addition, we use credit reports in our credit decisioning processes and, accordingly, must comply with FCRA which requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report and requires persons that furnish loan payment information to credit bureaus to report such information accurately. We are also required to perform a reasonable investigation in the event we receive indirect disputes from the credit bureaus about the accuracy of our credit reporting for a particular consumer and to update any inaccurate information we discover. Although we have policies and procedures in place to comply with FCRA, we are subject to lawsuits alleging that we failed under FCRA to adequately investigate indirect disputes over credit reporting which we receive from one or more credit bureaus. We have experienced an increase in such FCRA claims since our business has grown and even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such suits, they could involve substantial time and expense to analyze and respond to, could divert management’s attention and other resources from running our business, and could lead to settlements, judgments, fines, penalties or injunctive relief.\n",
      "Changes in applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in government enforcement policies and priorities, may negatively impact the management of our business, results of operations, ability to offer certain products or the terms and conditions upon which they are offered, and ability to compete. \n",
      "Financial services regulation is constantly changing, and new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to operate as currently intended, and cause us to incur significant expense in order to ensure compliance. Federal and state financial services regulators are also enforcing existing laws, regulations, and rules aggressively and enhancing their supervisory expectations regarding the management of legal and regulatory compliance risks. These regulatory changes and uncertainties make our business planning more difficult and could result in changes to our business model and potentially adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent applicable, these laws can impose specific statutory liabilities upon creditors who fail to comply with their provisions and may affect the enforceability of a loan. \n",
      "Proposals to change the statutes affecting financial services companies are frequently introduced in Congress and state legislatures that, if enacted, may affect their operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. In addition, numerous federal and state regulators and SROs have the authority to promulgate or change regulations that could have a similar effect on our operating environment. We cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the ultimate impact that any such potential legislation or implementing regulations, or any such potential regulatory actions by federal or state regulators, would have upon our business. \n",
      "New laws, regulations, policy or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, or reexamination of current practices, could adversely impact our profitability, limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, affect retention of key personnel, or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs and/or customer remediation). These changes also may require us to invest significant resources, and devote significant management attention, to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business. For example, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Execution, along with other proposals related to equity market structure, in December 2022. If adopted as proposed, Regulation Best Execution and other recent proposals would substantially alter existing order routing, execution incentives and business practices. The SEC also finalized rules in February 2023 to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions in securities from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one (T+1). While the SEC compliance date for T+1 is not until May 2024, this change will require technological, operational, and compliance adjustments across the industry that are likely to be time consuming and costly for all market participants. In March 2023, the SEC proposed multiple rules related to privacy and cybersecurity. Proposed amendments to Regulation S-P would, among other things: (i) require covered institutions (including broker-dealers and investment advisers) to adopt written policies and procedures for an incident response program to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and (ii) require covered institutions to have written policies and procedures to provide timely notification to affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was or is reasonably likely to have been accessed or used without authorization. The SEC reopened the comment period for the Investment Management Cybersecurity Release which proposed new rules that would require registered investment advisers and investment companies to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks, disclose information about cybersecurity risks and incidents, report information confidentially to the SEC about certain cybersecurity incidents, and maintain related records. In July 2023, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to address certain conflicts of interest \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "associated with the use of predictive data analytics by broker-dealers and investment advisers (“firms”) in investor interactions. If adopted, the proposed rules would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to evaluate and determine whether their use of certain technologies in investor interactions such as analytical, technological or computational functions, algorithms, models, correlation matrices or similar methods or processes that direct or optimize for investment related behavior, involves a conflict of interest that results in the broker-dealer or investment adviser’s interests being placed ahead of investors’ interests. Depending on the outcome of any final rule, our ability to use these technologies to generate business activity and revenue may be limited. See also “Lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that could impact our broker-dealer business and require us to make significant changes to our business model and practices, and could result in significant costs to our business or loss of current revenue streams”. Compliance with each of these rules, when and if required, would impose additional costs on our business. To the extent such proposals affect the equity market structure more broadly, our ability to generate revenue may be impaired. There is also the risk that, despite our best efforts, the SEC does not view our compliance measures as sufficient. This risk is substantially elevated where regulators adopt a substantial number of new rules in a short time frame. On October 13, 2023, the SEC adopted rules relating to providing additional disclosures in the securities lending market. These rules require any covered person that loans a reportable security on behalf of itself or another person to report certain material terms of those loans and related information to FINRA by the end of the day on which the loan is effected. FINRA in turn will make certain information it receives publicly available by the next business day. These regulations could make securities lending more costly, leading to less overall lending activity and a decrease in revenue. In addition, non-compliance with any adopted requirements would likely result in enforcement action by the SEC or FINRA.\n",
      "Extensive regulation and supervision have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a cost-effective manner and may subject us to material compliance costs and penalties.\n",
      "The Company, primarily through its subsidiary SoFi Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Many laws and regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. They encourage us to ensure a satisfactory level of lending in defined areas and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification. Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "We are subject to the risk that regulatory or enforcement agencies and/or consumer advocacy groups may assert that our business practices may violate certain rules, laws and regulations, including anti-discrimination statutes. \n",
      "Anti-discrimination statutes, such as the FHA and the ECOA and state law equivalents, prohibit creditors from discriminating against loan applicants and borrowers based on certain characteristics, such as race, religion and national origin. Various federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice and CFPB, take the position that these laws apply not only to intentional discrimination, but also to facially neutral practices that have a disparate impact on a group that shares a characteristic that a creditor may not consider in making credit decisions. State and federal regulators, as well as consumer advocacy groups and plaintiffs’ attorneys, are focusing greater attention on “disparate impact” claims. Similarly, these regulatory agencies and litigants could take the position that the geographical footprint within which we conduct lending activity or the manner in which we advertise loans, disproportionately excludes potential borrowers belonging to a protected class, and constitutes unlawful “redlining”. Although we utilize an automated underwriting process to originate loans, we frequently adjust pricing strategies which increases our risk of inadvertently violating the FHA and the ECOA. These regulatory agencies could also take the position that the underwriting or credit models or algorithms we use produce disparate outcomes or do not produce sufficient information about a credit decision to satisfy applicant notification requirements under ECOA. In addition to reputational harm, violations of the FHA and the ECOA can result in actual damages, punitive damages, injunctive or equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and civil money penalties. \n",

      "The Investment Advisers operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to, among other things, the anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions, which apply to their relationships with our members who are their advisory clients, as well as the funds managed by the Investment Advisers. These provisions and duties also impose certain restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our members, fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on transactions with our affiliates. Our Investment Advisers are also subject to other requirements under the Advisers Act and related regulations. These additional requirements relate to matters including, among others, maintaining effective and comprehensive compliance programs, record-keeping and reporting and disclosure requirements. Further, in 2022 and 2023, the SEC proposed numerous amendments to the Advisers Act rules, which are likely to present a number of additional significant and burdensome compliance challenges for registered investment advisers. In addition, our Investment Advisers have been in the past, and will be in the future, subject to SEC examination. Moreover, the Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. The investment advisers are also subject to applicable state securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator was small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing members or fail to gain new members. See Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”.\n",
      "Our subsidiary, SoFi Securities, is an affiliated SEC-registered broker-dealer and FINRA member. The securities industry is highly regulated, including under federal, state and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, and we may be adversely affected by regulatory changes related to suitability of financial products, supervision, sales practices, advertising, application of fiduciary standards, best execution and market structure, any of which could limit our business and damage our reputation. FINRA has adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to sales practices, advertising, registration of personnel, compliance and supervision, and compensation and disclosure, to which SoFi Securities and its personnel are subject. FINRA and the SEC also have the authority to conduct examinations of SoFi Securities, and may also conduct administrative proceedings. Additionally, material expansions of the business in which SoFi Securities engages are subject to approval by FINRA. This could delay, or even prevent, the firm’s ability to expand its securities and brokerage offerings in the future. \n",
      "From time to time, SoFi Securities and the Investment Advisers may be threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims. As previously noted, these entities are also subject to regulatory examinations and inspections by regulators (including the SEC and FINRA, as applicable). Compliance and trading problems or other deficiencies or weaknesses that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC and FINRA, by dissatisfied members or others, or that are identified by regulators themselves are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against SoFi Securities and the Investment Advisers by members or disciplinary action being taken by regulators against us or our personnel. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or our own policies and procedures could result in fines, litigation, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, which could have a material effect on our overall financial results. For example, in December 2023, FINRA found that SoFi Securities failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system reasonably designed to supervise its fully paid securities lending offerings. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and our brand and lead to material legal, regulatory and financial exposure (including fines and other penalties), cause us to lose existing members or fail to gain new members. In addition, in the normal course of business, SoFi Securities and the Investment Advisers discuss matters raised by its regulators during regulatory examinations or otherwise upon their inquiry. These matters could also result in censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n",

These proposals cover material regulatory topics, including: (i) environmental, social, and governance issues for investment advisers and registered investment companies; (ii) outsourcing by investment advisers; and (iii) safeguarding and custody of client assets. If enacted, compliance with each of these proposed rules would impose additional costs on our business. There is also the risk that, despite our best efforts, the SEC does not view our compliance measures as sufficient. This risk is substantially elevated where regulators adopt a substantial number of new rules in a short time frame.\n",

      "We recently transferred our digital assets-related trading services to comply with regulations governing bank holding companies; this transfer could adversely impact our member relationships and our reputation.\n",
      "Until recently, we offered virtual currency and digital asset-related trading services through SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, a subsidiary licensed and registered with various governmental authorities as a MSB, money transmitter, virtual currency business or the equivalent. In connection with our approval as a bank holding company in February 2022, the Federal Reserve determined that SoFi Digital Assets, LLC was engaged in certain digital asset-related activities that the Federal Reserve has not found to be permissible for a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y. Section 4(a)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act permitted us to continue our digital assets related offering for a two-year conformance period from the date we became a bank holding company. In compliance with the requirement that we conform our activities to those permissible for a bank holding company, in December 2023, we ceased offering digital-asset related trading services in all states except New York. We provided a majority of our members with the option to either close their digital asset account or migrate their digital assets accounts to Blockchain.com. Members located in New York were not eligible for account migration, so those member accounts remained open for sell orders only until January 28, 2024, following which any open New York accounts were closed. All transaction fees from any sales from digital assets accounts will be reimbursed. As part of our transfer of our digital asset-related activities we entered into a referral arrangement with Blockchain.com, and we have and may continue to enter into additional referral arrangements with other companies that can provide digital-asset related trading services to our members. Although we do not expect the transfer of our digital asset-related activities or entry into the referral arrangements to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation or financial results, we cannot guarantee that our members will not experience a negative impact with respect to their digital asset positions. In addition, these are recent events and there is no guarantee we will not face member dissatisfaction or litigation, or harm to our reputation, or adverse regulatory consequences, from such developments.\n",
      "Furthermore, if our prior digital asset-related trading services are the subject of regulatory scrutiny or enforcement actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. There has been a significant amount of guidance, reports, and public statements issued by federal and state financial regulators regarding the legal permissibility of, and supervisory considerations relating to, financial institutions engaging in digital assets-related activities. Many U.S. regulators, including the SEC, FinCEN, the CFTC, the IRS, and state regulators including the New York State Department of Financial Services, have made official pronouncements, pursued cases against businesses in the digital assets space or issued guidance or rules regarding the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Both federal and state agencies have instituted enforcement actions against those violating their interpretation of existing laws. Other U.S. and many state agencies have offered little or incomplete official guidance regarding the treatment of digital assets. For example, the CFTC has publicly taken the position that certain virtual currencies, which term includes digital assets, are commodities. Senior SEC staff members have created additional ambiguity about certain digital assets, including Ether, by refusing to affirmatively state whether they are “commodities” subject to CFTC jurisdiction or “securities” subject to SEC jurisdiction. In addition, in 2023, the SEC brought high profile enforcement actions against companies that intermediate transactions in digital assets. For example, in June 2023, the SEC filed lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance Holdings Limited and its affiliate BAM Trading Services Inc. (collectively, “Binance”) alleging, among other allegations, that Coinbase operated its crypto trading platform as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency and for its failure to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. The SEC alleges that Binance was operating unregistered national exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies and the unregistered offer and sale of crypto assets. If the SEC or another federal or state regulator alleges that any assets we offered are securities or that we have violated any other federal or state securities law or regulation, we could face potential liability, including an enforcement action or private class action lawsuits, and face the costs of defending ourselves in the action, including potential fines, penalties, reputation harm, and potential loss of revenue. See “We may become subject to enforcement actions or litigation as a result of our failure to comply with laws and regulations, even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional”.\n",
      "Failure to comply with anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions regulations, and similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. \n",
      "Various laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, such as the BSA, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Under these laws and regulations, financial institutions are broadly defined to include banks and MSBs such as money transmitters. In 2013, FinCEN issued guidance regarding the applicability of the BSA to administrators and exchangers of convertible virtual currency, clarifying that they are MSBs, and more specifically, money transmitters. The BSA requires banks and MSBs to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other requirements. State regulators may impose similar requirements on licensed money transmitters. In addition, our contracts with financial institution partners and other third parties may contractually require us to maintain an anti-money \n",

Our subsidiary, SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, is registered with FinCEN as an MSB. Registration as an MSB subjects us to the regulatory and supervisory jurisdiction of FinCEN and the IRS, the anti-money laundering provisions of the BSA and its implementing regulations applicable to MSBs. Although we have exited our digital assets business, the Company, including SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, may still be subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our prior business practices.\n",
      "We are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, terrorists or terrorist organizations, and other sanctioned persons and entities. \n",
      "Our failure to comply with anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions regulations, and similar laws could subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties, or result in the loss or restriction of our national bank charter, MSB or broker-dealer registrations and state licenses, or liability under our contracts with third parties, which may significantly affect our ability to conduct some aspects of our business. Changes in this regulatory environment, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government, may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business. \n",
      "We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to significant adverse consequences, including criminal or civil liability, and harm our business.\n",
      "We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. Although our operations are currently concentrated in the U.S., as we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we have engaged and may further engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. The failure to comply with any such laws could subject us to criminal or civil liability, cause us significant reputational harm and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "We conduct our business operations through subsidiaries and may in the future rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our cash flows.\n",
      "We may in the future depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds to or from certain subsidiaries, including SoFi Securities and SoFi Bank. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur and otherwise conduct our business by, among other things, reducing our liquidity in the form of corporate cash. In addition to negatively affecting our business, a significant decrease in our liquidity could also reduce investor confidence in us. Certain rules and regulations of the SEC and FINRA may limit the extent to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries may distribute capital to us. For example, under FINRA rules applicable to SoFi Securities, a dividend in excess of 10% of a member firm’s excess net capital may not be paid without FINRA’s prior written approval. In addition, the OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, under the National Bank Act, SoFi Bank generally may, without prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend but only so long as the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, in the current year do not exceed net income for the current year to date plus retained net income for the prior two years. Compliance with these rules may impede our ability to receive dividends, distributions and other payments from SoFi Securities and SoFi Bank.\n",

      "The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation and oversight under federal, state, and applicable international laws. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we have received and may receive or be subject to inquiries or investigations by state and federal regulatory or enforcement agencies and bodies, such as the CFPB, SEC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the FHFA, the VA, the state attorneys general, state financial regulatory agencies, other state or federal agencies and SROs like FINRA. We also have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries from state regulatory agencies regarding requirements to obtain licenses from or register with those states, including in states where we have previously determined that we are not required to obtain such a license or be registered with the state. In addition, we have been threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, consumer financial services and other matters. We are also subject to periodic regulatory examinations and inspections. Compliance and trading problems or other deficiencies or weaknesses that are reported to regulators, such as the OCC, SEC, FINRA, the CFPB or state regulators, by dissatisfied customers or others, or that are identified by regulators themselves, are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against us by customers or disciplinary action being taken against us or our employees by regulators or enforcement agencies. To resolve issues raised in examinations or other governmental actions, we may be required to take various corrective actions, including changing certain business practices, making refunds or taking other actions that could be financially or competitively detrimental to us.\n",
      "Any such inquiries, investigations, lawsuits, arbitrations, administrative claims or other inquiries have in the past and could in the future involve substantial time and expense to analyze and respond to, divert management’s attention and other resources from running our business, and lead to fines, penalties, injunctive relief, and the need to obtain additional licenses that we do not currently possess. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to additional investigations and enforcement actions from other agencies or litigants, and further divert management attention and resources from the operation of our business. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions arising out of any state or federal inquiries we receive could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n",
      "Lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that could impact our broker-dealer business and require us to make significant changes to our business model and practices, and could result in significant costs to our business or loss of current revenue streams.\n",
      "Various lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have recently made statements about business practices in which we and other broker-dealers engage, including SoFi Securities, and signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that, if acted upon, could impact our business. For example, a focus by regulators and lawmakers on PFOF, exchange rebates, and related conflicts of interest have resulted in new proposed rules. Additionally, the SEC has proposed new requirements regarding best execution (Regulation Best Execution), PFOF and a rule to prohibit volume-based transaction pricing in connection with the execution of agency-related orders in national market system stock. The SEC also issued an order in September 2023 directing the equity exchanges and FINRA to file a new national marketing system plan. This order and other proposals have the potential to substantially reshape U.S. equities markets in intended and unintended ways, and to substantially alter existing order routing, execution incentives and business practices. The SEC also finalized rules in February 2023 to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions in securities from two business days after the trade (T+2) to one (T+1). The SEC compliance date for T+1 is in May 2024 and this change has required and will continue to require technological, operational, and compliance adjustments across the industry that are likely to be time consuming and costly for all market participants. Additionally, a focus by lawmakers and regulators on so-called gamification and digital engagement practices has resulted in a new rule proposed by the SEC and, in July 2023, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to address certain conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics by broker-dealers and investment advisers in investor interactions. If adopted, the proposed rules would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to evaluate and determine whether their use of certain technologies in investor interactions such as analytical, technological or computational functions, algorithms, models, correlation matrices or similar methods or processes that direct or optimize for investment related behavior, involves a conflict of interest that results in the broker-dealer or investment adviser’s interests being placed ahead of investors’ interests. A Fall 2023 SEC rulemaking agenda indicates that adoptions of these proposed rules are likely.\n",
      "To the extent that the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory authorities or legislative bodies adopt additional regulations or legislation in respect of any of these areas or relating to any other aspect of our business, we could face a heightened risk of potential regulatory violations and could be required to make significant changes to our business model and practices, which changes may not be successful.

      "Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities. \n",
      "We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by them. For example, we are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and (ii) requires certain disclosures to consumers about our practices for the collection, sharing and safeguarding of their information and their right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions). The GLBA and other state laws also require that we implement and maintain certain security measures, policies and procedures to protect personal information. \n",
      "Furthermore, legislators and/or regulators are increasingly adopting new and/or amending existing privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices; our policies and practices related to the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information; and some of our current or planned business activities. New requirements, originating from new or amended laws, could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. \n",
      "Compliance with current or future privacy, information security and data protection laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services (such as products or services that involve sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information), which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. A failure by us or a third-party contractor providing services to us to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements or industry guidelines, or our terms of use with our users, may result in sanctions, statutory or contractual damages or litigation (including class actions) and may subject us to reputational harm. Additionally, there is always a danger that regulators can attempt to assert authority over our business in the area of privacy, information security and data protection. Furthermore, if our vendors and/or service providers are or become subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions that have enacted more stringent and expansive legislation applicable to privacy, information and/or data protection, the costs that these vendors and service providers must incur in becoming compliant may be passed along to us, resulting in increasing costs on our business. \n",
      "Concerns in our ability, perceived or otherwise, to protect the privacy and security of personal information may affect our ability to retain and engage new and existing members, clients, investors, and employees, and thereby affect our financial condition. Furthermore, failure to comply or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules, and regulations may subject us to examinations, investigations, and general heightened scrutiny that may cause us to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n",
      "Privacy requirements, including notice and opt-out requirements, under the GLBA and FCRA are enforced by the FTC, the OCC and by the CFPB through UDAAP and are a standard component of OCC and CFPB compliance and examinations. State entities also may initiate actions for alleged violations of privacy or security requirements under state law. Our failure to comply with privacy, information security and data protection laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions, litigation, fines or sanctions, consumer or merchant actions and damage to our reputation and brand, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n",
      "Should we undertake an international expansion of our business, particularly if we commence doing business in one or more countries of the EU or the United Kingdom (the “UK”), we will be required to comply with stringent privacy and data protection laws. Within the EU, legislators have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. Should we commence doing business in Europe, the GDPR will impose additional obligations and risk upon our business, which may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any noncompliance. We may incur substantial expense in complying with obligations imposed by the GDPR and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. \n",

      "In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the “UK GDPR”. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Noncompliance with the UK GDPR may result in significant monetary penalties. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the EC has issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.\n",
      "In addition, around the world many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. For example, we are subject to stringent privacy and data protection requirements in Hong Kong. Also, many jurisdictions where we may seek to expand our business in the future are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. Additional jurisdictions with stringent data protection laws include Brazil and China. In the United States, the SEC proposed multiple rules related to privacy and cybersecurity in March 2023. Proposed amendments to Regulation S-P would, among other things: (i) require covered institutions (including broker-dealers and investment advisers) to adopt written policies and procedures for an incident response program to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and (ii) require covered institutions to have written policies and procedures to provide timely notification to affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was or is reasonably likely to have been accessed or used without authorization. The SEC reopened the comment period for the Investment Management Cybersecurity Release which proposed new rules that would require registered investment advisers and investment companies to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks, disclose information about cybersecurity risks and incidents, report information confidentially to the SEC about certain cybersecurity incidents, and maintain related records. While we believe we have robust policies and procedures addressing incidents involving unauthorized access to or use of customer information, these regulations have and may in the future require us to amend our current incident response program. In addition, these regulations may interfere with our intended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.\n",
      "The regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other personal information, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with laws in other jurisdictions or with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. We therefore cannot yet fully determine the impact existing and/or future laws, rules, regulations and industry standards may have on our business or operations. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources or the imposition of significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, any such action, particularly to the extent we were found to be guilty of violations or otherwise liable for damages, would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "Any such laws, rules, regulations and industry standards may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions, subject to differing interpretations or may conflict with our current or future practices. Additionally, our customers may be subject to differing privacy laws, rules and legislation, which may mean that they require us to be bound by varying contractual requirements applicable to certain other jurisdictions. Adherence to such contractual requirements may impact our collection, use, processing, storage, sharing and disclosure of various types of information including financial information and other personal information, and may mean we become bound by, or voluntarily comply with, self-regulatory or other industry standards relating to these matters that may further change as laws, rules and regulations evolve. Complying with these requirements and changing our policies and practices may be onerous and costly, and we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative and other developments. These changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products and services and/or increase our cost of doing business. As we expand our customer base, these requirements may vary from customer to customer, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. \n",

The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "It may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. \n",
      "Our ability to provide our products and services to our members and technology platform clients depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate our business processes and know-how, and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful. \n",
      "In addition, our platform or those of third-party service providers that we utilize may infringe upon claims of third-party intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes, or in receiving amounts due to us under indemnification obligations from third-party service providers. The costs of defending any such claims or litigation could be significant and, if we are unsuccessful, could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, which would negatively impact our financial performance. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, our ability to maintain our platform could be adversely affected. \n",
      "Some aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business. \n",
      "We incorporate open source software into our proprietary platform and into other processes supporting our business. Such open source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License or other open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of our platform and negatively affects our business operations. \n",
      "Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If portions of our proprietary platform are determined to be subject to an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or change our business activities. In addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business. \n",
      "Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs, negative publicity, changes to our business model, and requirements resulting in increased expenses. \n",
      "Our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including as a result of the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal enforcement agencies on the financial services industry. \n",
      "From time to time, we are also involved in, or the subject of, reviews, requests for information, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by state and federal governmental agencies and SROs, regarding our business activities and our qualifications to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions, which has in the past and could in the future subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices and other requirements resulting in increased expenses and diminished earnings. Our involvement in any such matter also has in the past and could in the future cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor. Moreover, any settlement, or any consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by a government agency, may prompt litigation or additional investigations or proceedings as other litigants or other government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities.

      "In addition, a number of participants in the financial services industry have been the subject of: putative class action lawsuits; state attorney general actions and other state regulatory actions; federal regulatory enforcement actions, including actions relating to alleged unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices; violations of state licensing and lending laws, including state usury laws; actions alleging discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other prohibited bases; and allegations of noncompliance with various state and federal laws and regulations relating to originating and servicing consumer finance loans. For example, we entered into a settlement agreement on April 18, 2022 related to a putative class action in which it was alleged that we engaged in unlawful lending discrimination through policies and practices by making applicants who are conditional permanent residents or DACA holders ineligible for loans or eligible only with a co-signer who is U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. We made an aggregate payment to the class and the class counsel in an immaterial amount. In addition, as a financial services company, errors in performing settlement functions, including clerical, technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities could lead to censures, fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liabilities in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by transaction counterparties and others.\n",
      "The current regulatory environment, increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement have resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent us from providing certain products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not, in the future, affect how we conduct our business and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, legal proceedings brought under state consumer protection statutes or under several of the various federal consumer financial services statutes may result in a separate fine for each violation of the statute, which, particularly in the case of class action lawsuits, could result in damages substantially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities. \n",
      "In addition, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance and other issues that require us to make operational changes and, depending on the nature of the issue, result in financial remediation to impacted members. These self-identified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant, depending on the issue and the number of members impacted, and also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional risk. See Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”.\n",
      "Changes in tax law and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements. \n",
      "We operate in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governments. U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations. U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, future changes to U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Several of the proposals currently being considered, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our future effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”), an international association of 38 countries, including the U.S., has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles. These guidelines create tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines. \n",

      "We are currently not deemed to be an “investment company” subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). No opinion or no-action position has been requested of the SEC on our status as an Investment Company. There is no guarantee we will continue to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act and were we to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, the increased reporting and operating requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. \n",
      "In addition, if the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that we are in violation of the Investment Company Act for having failed to register as an investment company thereunder, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) we could be sued by investors in us and in our securities for damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which we are a party that is made in, or \n",

      "\n",
      "We rely on our management team and will require additional key personnel to grow our business, and the loss of key management members or key employees, or an inability to hire key personnel, could harm our business. \n",
      "We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management, who have significant experience in the financial services and technology industries, are responsible for our core competencies and would be difficult to replace. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are usually in high demand even in an uncertain economy, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all, and our other employees may be required to take on additional responsibilities. Furthermore, many candidates evaluate year over year stock growth trends for a sense of the potential long-term value of their proposed stock awards, or have recently begun to discount the value of growth stocks on the whole. The volatility of the market price of our common stock could harm our ability to attract and retain talent. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n",
      "The job market and the optimization of our workforce creates a challenge and potential risk as we strive to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. \n",
      "Competition for certain of our employees, including highly skilled technology and product professionals responsible for the design, engineering and operation of systems, is competitive, which can present a risk as we compete for experienced candidates, especially if the competition is able to offer more attractive financial terms of employment. This risk extends to our current employee population. We also invest significant time and expense in engaging and developing our employees, which also increases their value to other companies that may seek to recruit them. Turnover can result in significant replacement costs and lost productivity. \n",
      "In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in the recent past, we laid off a relatively small number of employees even though we intend to continue to hire in other areas. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and optimize our business and organizational structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. See also “We transitioned to a flexible-first workforce model, which could subject us to increased business continuity and cyber risks, as well as other operational challenges and risks that could significantly harm our business and operations” for more information on the impact of a flexible workforce model on corporate culture and employee retention.\n",
      "In addition, U.S. immigration policy has made it more difficult for qualified foreign nationals to obtain or maintain work visas under the H-1B classification. These H-1B visa limitations make it more difficult and/or more expensive for us to hire the skilled professionals we need to execute our growth strategy, especially engineering, data analytics and risk management personnel, and may adversely impact our business. \n",
      "We transitioned to a flexible-first workforce model, which could subject us to increased business continuity and cyber risks, as well as other operational challenges and risks that could significantly harm our business and operations.\n",
      "We offer most of our employees the choice of working full time in the office, a hybrid approach, or full-time remote. In 2023 we announced an increase in in-office collaboration for non-remote employees who are returning to the office for a specified number of days per month, varying by business team. This return to the office for non-remote employees is limited, and we expect many employees to continue to work remotely for a number of days per week. As a result, we expect to continue to be subject to the challenges and risks of having a remote workforce, as well as new challenges and risks from operating with a hybrid workforce. For example, our employees are accessing our servers remotely through home or other networks to perform their job responsibilities. Such security systems may be less secure than those used in our offices, which may subject us to \n",

      "increased security risks, including cybersecurity-related events, and expose us to risks of data or financial loss and associated disruptions to our business operations. Additionally, employees who access company data and systems remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could place additional pressure on our user infrastructure and third parties that are not easily mitigated. These risks include home internet availability affecting work continuity and efficiency, and additional dependencies on third-party communication tools, such as instant messaging and online meeting platforms. We may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote employees, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing our employees to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. While most of our operations can be performed remotely and we believe have operated effectively, there is no guarantee that this will continue or that we will continue to be as effective while operating a flexible-first workforce model because our team is dispersed.\n",
      "Additionally, operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work in flexible locations and on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our workforce to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect workforce morale. If we are unable to manage the cybersecurity and other risks of a flexible-first workforce model, and maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale, our business could be harmed or otherwise adversely impacted.\n",
      "Our business is subject to the risks of natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures and similar events, including public health crises, and to interruptions by human-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and other actions, which may impact the demand for our products or our members’ ability to repay their loans. \n",
      "Events beyond our control may damage our ability to maintain our platform and provide services to our members. Such events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, public health crises, power or other outages, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. Because we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality service to our members, disruptions could harm our ability to effectively run our business. Moreover, our members and customers face similar risks, which could directly or indirectly impact our business. We currently use AWS and would be unable to switch instantly to another system in the event of failure to access AWS. This means that an outage of AWS could result in our system being unavailable for a significant period of time. Terrorism, cyberattacks and other criminal, tortious or unintentional actions could also give rise to significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular are unclear, however we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our offices may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. We have large offices located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Salt Lake City, Utah, regions that are prone to events such as seismic activity and severe weather, that have experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events and at an increasing rate. Examples include drought and water scarcity, warmer temperatures, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shut-offs associated with wildfire prevention. The increasing intensity of drought throughout California and Utah and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages. Although we maintain a disaster response plan and insurance, such events could disrupt our business, the business of our partners or third-party suppliers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain and resume operations. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or other disruptions. Comparable natural and other risks may reduce demand for our products or cause our members to suffer significant losses and/or incur significant disruption in their respective operations, which may affect their ability to satisfy their obligations towards us. All of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "Employee misconduct, which can be difficult to detect and deter, could harm our reputation and subject us to significant legal liability. \n",
      "We operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our members is of critical importance. We are subject to risks of errors and misconduct by our employees that could adversely affect our business, including: \n",

The precautions that we take to detect and deter employee misconduct might not be effective. If any of our employees engage in illegal, improper, or suspicious activity or other misconduct, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, member relationships, and our ability to attract new members.

      "Risk Management and Financial Reporting Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. \n",
      "Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a report by management on internal control over financial reporting and an attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm are required. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our annual reports on Form 10-K. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm must also attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the applicable stock exchange or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\n",
      "The annual internal control assessment required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley has diverted, and may in the future divert, internal resources and we have and may experience higher operating expenses, higher independent auditor and consulting fees in the future. To comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act and any new or revised accounting rules in the future, as necessary, we have, and may in the future further, work to upgrade SoFi’s legacy information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to hire the additional accounting and finance staff necessary to comply with these requirements, we may need to retain additional outside consultants. In addition, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of poor design and changes in our business. For example, our continuing growth and expansion in globally dispersed markets, such as our acquisition of Technisys, has placed and may in the future place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting, as acquisition targets may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We do not conduct a formal evaluation of companies’ internal control over financial reporting prior to an acquisition. We may be required to hire additional staff and incur substantial costs to implement the necessary new internal controls at companies we acquire. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of assessments by our independent registered public accounting firm and their attestation reports. If we or, if required, our independent registered public accounting firm, are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could negatively impact the price of our securities. \n",
      "As a result of any material weakness, restatement, change in accounting, or other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, we may face potential litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatement and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. We can provide no assurance that litigation or disputes will not arise in the future. Any such litigation or dispute related to our financial statements or internal controls, whether successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
      "We cannot assure you that there will not be additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting now or in the future. For example, as the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination, we inherited a material weakness from SCH related to the treatment of warrants issued by special acquisition companies which required SCH to restate its previously issued audited financial statements as of December 31, 2020. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could cause us to fail to timely detect errors and severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \n",
      "We adjust our total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service, and our total member count in any one period may not yet reflect such adjustments.\n",
      "We adjust our total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service. This could occur for a variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes or if a member requests that we close their account in accordance with our terms of service—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, additional grounds for removing members from our total member count could occur. The determination that a member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant members and their associated products are removed from our total member count. However, depending on the length of the evaluation process, that removal may not take place in the same period in which the member was added to our member count or the same period in which the circumstances leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member count in any one period may not yet reflect such adjustments. In any given period, we estimate that up to 10% of our members may be under evaluation for removal in accordance with our terms of service; however, we cannot assure you that this percentage in any period will not be more significant and have an adverse impact on our stock price or results of operations.\n",
      "Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \n",
      "Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\n",
      "Our management has limited experience in operating a public company.\n",
      "We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management intends to continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel devote and we expect will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Furthermore, new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules and regulations in the future may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, which would increase our net loss for the foreseeable future. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, its board committees or as executive officers.\n",
      "Our executive officers have limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, which may increase the amount of their time devoted to these activities and result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the business. We continue to evaluate whether we have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies. We have in the past and may in the future expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which has caused and may in the future cause our operating costs to increase.

      "Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective. \n",
      "Our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject, including interest rate risk, credit risk, deposit risk, market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, and reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when a loan obligor fails to meet the terms of a loan repayment obligation, the loan enters default, and if uncured results in financial loss of remaining principal and interest to the loan purchaser. Our exposure to credit risk mainly arises from our lending activities, including SoFi Credit Card. Deposit risk refers to accelerated availability of depositor funds, prior to settlement, risk of ACH returns or merchant settlements, and transactional limits that may be applied to deposit accounts. Market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market factors, such as interest rates, asset prices, and foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that our financial position or results of operations could be positively or negatively impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. We may in the future be subject to increasing foreign currency exchange rate risk with our acquisition of Technisys, a foreign company, and we continue to pursue a diversified durable growth strategy with expansion via new products and geographies. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet obligations (e.g., current and future cash flow needs) and support business growth. We actively monitor our liquidity position at the broker-dealer and SoFi Bank. Strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment, ineffective business strategies, improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business and competitive environment. \n",
      "Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, controls, people (e.g., human error or misconduct) or systems (e.g., technology problems), business continuity or external events (e.g., natural disasters), compliance, reputational, regulatory, or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us, fraud losses attributed to applications and any associated fines and monetary penalties as a result, transaction processing, or employees, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business. We believe operational risk is one of the most prevalent forms of risk in our risk profile. We strive to manage operational risk by establishing policies and procedures to accomplish timely and efficient processing, obtaining periodic internal control attestations from management, conducting internal process Risk Control Self-Assessments and audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. Our operational risk, and the amount we invest in risk management, may increase as we introduce new products and product features, and as new threat actors and evolving threat vectors, such as account takeover tactics, increase and become more sophisticated. In order to be effective, among other things, our enterprise risk management capabilities must adapt and align to support any new product or loan features, capability, strategic development, or external change.\n",
      "Cybersecurity risk is the risk of a malicious technological attack intended to impact the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of our systems and data, including, but not limited to, sensitive client data. Our technology and cybersecurity teams rely on a layered system of preventive and detective technologies, controls, and policies to detect, mitigate, and contain cybersecurity threats. In addition, our cybersecurity team, and the third-party consultants they engage, regularly assess our cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts. Cyberattacks can also result in financial and reputational risk. \n",
      "Reputational risk is the risk arising from possible negative perceptions of us, whether true or not, among our current and prospective members, clients, counterparties, employees, and regulators. The potential for either enhancing or damaging our reputation is inherent in almost all aspects of business activity. We attempt to manage this risk through our commitment to a set of core values that emphasize and reward high standards of ethical behavior, maintaining a culture of compliance, and by being responsive to member and regulatory requirements.\n",
      "Risk, including, but not limited to, the risks outlined above, is inherent in our business, and therefore, despite our efforts to manage risk, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain unexpected losses. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted to the extent our business model, operational processes, control functions, technological capabilities, risk analyses, and business/product knowledge do not adequately identify and manage potential risks associated with our strategic initiatives. There also may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be otherwise adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n",

      "The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenues or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, our reported financial results may be over- or understated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n",
      "In addition, operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including the competition we face, and our ability to attract and retain members and enterprise partnerships, and macroeconomic risks, while generating sustained revenues through the Financial Services Productivity Loop. Additionally, our business may be affected by reductions in consumer borrowing, spending and investing, consumer deposits or investment by technology platform clients from time to time as a result of a number of factors, including the state of the overall economy, which may be difficult to predict. This may result in decreased revenue levels, and we may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause our operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected. These factors make creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging and, as a result, we may fall materially short of our forecasts and expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in us. \n",

On January 29, 2024, we provided guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024, as well as through 2026 and beyond. This guidance includes forward-looking statements based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are based on information known when they are issued, and, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies relating to our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. \n",

Security breaches could occur from outside our company, and also from the actions of persons inside our company who may have authorized or unauthorized access to our technology systems, despite the required investment in security controls. We also face security threats from malicious threat actors that could obtain unauthorized access to our systems and networks, which threats we anticipate will continue to grow in scope and complexity over time. In addition, security threats may increase as a result of geopolitical events, such as in connection with the war between Israel and Hamas, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. These events could interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services. Although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us, no assurance is given that this will continue to be the case in the future. \n",
      "Cybersecurity risks in the financial services industry have increased, in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized criminals, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyberattacks and other security breaches involving the theft of non-public and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as consumer-facing websites. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but there are no assurances that these mechanisms will be effective and early detection efforts may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. Despite our investments in detection strategy and a 24/7/365 security operations center, we also may fail to detect the existence of a security breach related to the information of our members.\n",
      "Cybersecurity risks have also subjected us to additional regulation. For example, in July 2023, the SEC proposed new rules and amendments to address certain conflicts of interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics by broker-dealers and investment advisers in investor interactions. If adopted, the proposed rules would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to evaluate and determine whether their use of certain technologies in investor interactions such as analytical, technological or computational functions, algorithms, models, correlation matrices or similar methods or processes that direct or optimize for investment related behavior, involves a conflict of interest that results in the broker-dealer or investment adviser’s interests being placed ahead of investors’ interests. To the extent we determined there were conflicts of interest, we would be required to eliminate, or neutralize the effect of, any such conflicts. The proposed rules would also require us to have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the proposed rules and to make and keep books and records related to these requirements.\n",

Because each loan that we originate involves, in part, our proprietary automated underwriting process, any failure of our computer systems involving our automated underwriting process and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our automated underwriting process could compromise our ability to accurately evaluate potential members, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result in disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we make to our members. Additionally, if hackers were able to access our secure files, they might be able to gain access to the personal information of our members, prospective members, technology platform clients and the customers of our technology platform clients. If we are unable to prevent such activity, we may be subject to significant liability, negative publicity and a material loss of members or technology platform clients, all of which may negatively affect our business. In addition, there have in the past been a number of well-publicized attacks or breaches affecting companies in the financial services industry that have heightened concern by consumers, which could also intensify regulatory focus, cause users to lose trust in the security of the industry in general and result in reduced use of our services and increased costs, all of which could also have a material adverse effect on our business. \n",

      "many states continue to enact legislation on matters of privacy, information security, cybersecurity, data breach and data breach notification requirements. For example, as of January 1, 2020, the CCPA granted additional consumer rights with respect to data privacy in California. The CCPA was amended by a California ballot initiative, the CPRA, in November 2020. The CCPA amendments, including expanded rights for consumers and obligations for businesses, went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA, among other things, entitles California residents to know how their personal information is being collected and shared, to access or request the deletion of their personal information and to opt out of the sharing of their personal information. The amended CCPA also created a new state agency, the CPPA, and vested it with full administrative power, authority and jurisdiction to implement and enforce the CCPA. Generally, personal information that we process is subject to GLBA and thereby exempt from CCPA coverage. However, the CCPA regulates other personal information that we collect and process in connection with the business. While we have made modifications to our data collection and processing practices and policies to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, we cannot predict their impact on our business, operations or financial condition. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to further modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. Additionally, our broker-dealer and investment adviser are subject to SEC Regulation S-P, which requires that these businesses maintain policies and procedures addressing the protection of customer information and records. This includes protecting against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information. Regulation S-P also requires these businesses to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers describing information sharing policies and informing customers of their rights. In March 2023, the SEC proposed multiple rules related to privacy and cybersecurity. Proposed amendments to Regulation S-P would, among other things: (i) require covered institutions (including broker-dealers and investment advisers) to adopt written policies and procedures for an incident response program to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and (ii) require covered institutions to have written policies and procedures to provide timely notification to affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was or is reasonably likely to have been accessed or used without authorization. The SEC reopened the comment period for the Investment Management Cybersecurity Release which proposed new rules that would require registered investment advisers and investment companies to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks, disclose information about cybersecurity risks and incidents, report information confidentially to the SEC about certain cybersecurity incidents, and maintain related records.\n",
      "Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (UK GDPR), various Latin American (LATAM) privacy laws such as Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) and Argentina’s Ley de Protección de los Datos Personales (PDPA) impose strict requirements for the processing of personal data of individuals located, respectively, within the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK) and LATAM region. For example, under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the company, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. Certain jurisdictions, such as the EU, Switzerland, the UK and LATAM have enacted cross-border personal data transfers laws regulating personal data flows to third countries. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of personal data protection. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” that are designed to be a valid mechanism by which entities can transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. Currently, these Standard Contractual clauses are a valid mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA. The Standard Contractual Clauses, however, require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data. In addition, laws in Switzerland, the UK and LATAM similarly restrict personal data transfers outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States of America that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection. In addition to European restrictions on cross-border personal data transfers, other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or elsewhere. Inability to import personal data to the United States may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to collaborate with parties subject to European and other data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\n",

      "Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, including limiting our activities in certain states and/or jurisdictions, address legal claims, and sustain monetary penalties, reputational damage and/or other harms to our business. Further, in certain cases we rely on the data processing, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity practices of our third-party service providers, including with regard to maintaining the confidentiality, security and integrity of data. If we fail to manage our third-party service providers or their relevant practices, or if they fail to meet any requirements with regard to data processing, privacy, data protection or cybersecurity required by applicable legal or contractual obligations that we face (including any applicable requirements of our clients), we may be liable in certain cases. Legal obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity and data protection may require us to manage our third-party service providers and their practices and to enter into agreements with them in certain cases. We may face difficulties in binding our third-party service providers to these agreements and otherwise managing their relevant practices, which may subject us to claims, proceedings, and liabilities.\n",

Failure to adhere to such practices may result in regulatory scrutiny and investigation (including the potential for fines and monetary penalties), complaints by affected members, reputational damage and other harm to our business. If either we, or the third-party service providers with which we share member data, are unable to address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in additional costs and liability, damage our reputation, and harm our business. \n",

      "Our ability to deliver products and services to our members and clients, and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and third-party data centers, as well as third-party service providers. Our computer systems and third-party providers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure or errors, employee misconfiguration of resources or misdirected communications, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health pandemics, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other events. For example, in September 2023, the SoFi Invest platform experienced a service interruption that resulted in some of our members being unable to view certain of their account information and unable to buy and sell securities and other financial products on our platform for a period of time. Any such events, including persistent interruptions or perceptions of such interruptions whether true or not, in our products and services could cause members to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to otherwise avoid our products and services, and otherwise have a negative effect on our business and technology infrastructure (including our computer network systems), which could lead to member dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Additionally, our insurance policies might be insufficient to cover a claim made against us by any such members affected by any disruptions, outages, or other performance or infrastructure problems.\n",
      "Additionally, our reliance on third-party providers may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, as our operations will depend upon such third-party service providers communicating appropriately and responding swiftly to their own service disruptions through industry standard best practices in business continuity and/or disaster recovery. As a last resort, we may rely on our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations for a prolonged period of time or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n",
      "The implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors or system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial and increasing investments in “observability”, or the monitoring of our systems, but limitations or failures in those systems may exacerbate other problems by preventing us from anticipating or quickly detecting issues. In addition, our ability to monitor third party services and service providers is limited, and so our ability to anticipate, detect, and remediate anomalies in those services is also more limited when compared to our internal systems monitoring.\n",

In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court and other states courts have upheld the validity of federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court, there is still some uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision.

      "At SoFi, we recognize the importance of information security practices designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company information and the personal information that our customers share with us. Using guidance set forth in our Enterprise Risk Management program, we have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program to lead and support the management of information security risks in accordance with our risk profile and business strategy, which is informed by recognized industry standards and frameworks, such as International Organization for Standardization 27002:2013. For additional guidance, we also refer to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council information security guidelines, and Center of Internet Security controls. \n",
      "Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a number of components, designed to identify, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity risks, including reliance on a layered system of preventative and detective technologies, controls, and policies designed to detect, mitigate, and contain cybersecurity threats. Information security program risk assessments and third party attestations and assessments are conducted periodically by both internal and external resources. We leverage qualified third-party security assessors to identify vulnerabilities through both internal and external penetration tests and perform internal cybersecurity maturity assessments. In addition, our internal audit team conducts an information security and information technology audit on an annual basis. We are also subject to examinations by applicable regulators. We conduct cybersecurity awareness training for personnel upon hire and on a periodic basis thereafter, which includes phishing training campaigns. \n",
      "As part of our cybersecurity risk management program, SoFi maintains a formal Third-Party Security Risk Management program that provides oversight of cybersecurity risks related to supplier relationships. During supplier onboarding, we perform risk-based due diligence for suppliers with access to confidential SoFi information or that require technical integration with SoFi systems. This program includes the provision of a cybersecurity risk assessment to these suppliers during onboarding as well as ongoing monitoring, assessment, and contract review. \n",

      "We are a member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money. We refer to our customers as “members”, as defined under “Key Business Metrics”. Our mission is to help our members achieve financial independence in order to realize their ambitions. We were founded in 2011 and have developed a suite of financial products that offers the speed, selection, content and convenience that only an integrated digital platform can provide. Everything we do today is geared toward helping our members “Get Your Money Right” and we strive to innovate and build ways for our members to achieve this goal.\n",
      "In order to help achieve our mission, we offer personal loans, student loans, home loans and related servicing, as well as senior secured loans. We also offer a variety of financial services products, such as SoFi Money checking and savings, SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest, and SoFi Relay, that provide more daily interactions with our members, and we offer products and capabilities, such as SoFi At Work, that are designed to appeal to enterprises. We continued to expand our platform capabilities for enterprises through: (i) our acquisition of Galileo in 2020, which provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions and which has allowed us to vertically integrate across more of our financial services, and (ii) the Technisys Merger in the first quarter of 2022, through which we expanded our technology platform services to include a cloud-native, customizable, extensible core technology as well as access to a broader international market. We believe that these expansions will deepen our participation in the entire technology ecosystem powering digital financial services. \n",

      "Business Highlights\n",
      "We achieved strong results for our company for the year ended December 31, 2023, including record total net revenue of $2.1 billion, representing an increase of 35% over total net revenue in 2022. Record revenue at the company level was driven by record net revenue across all three of our business segments. We realized strong momentum in member and product growth and cross-buy adds, reflecting the benefits of our broad product suite and Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy. We added approximately 2.3 million new members during 2023, with over 7.5 million total members as of December 31, 2023, a 44% year over year increase. We also added approximately 3.2 million new products, with over 11.1 million total products as of December 31, 2023, a 41% year over year increase.\n",
      "Lending segment contribution profit of $823.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, at a margin of 60%, increased 24% over 2022, which had a contribution margin of 58%. Total net revenue of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 20% over 2022. Additionally, average net interest margin of 5.88% in 2023 increased 48 basis points compared to 5.40% in 2022. Growth in net interest income was driven by an increase in both average interest-earning assets and average yields, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Origination volume increased 34% year over year, primarily driven by demand for personal loans and despite continued macroeconomic headwinds in the student and home loan businesses. Student loans saw some increasing demand in the third quarter of 2023 ahead of the resumption of principal and interest payments on federally-held student loans, and we expect that we may continue to see modest growth in student loan refinancing. Our acquisition of Wyndham in the second quarter of 2023 provided increased capacity and capabilities for our home loans product, which contributed to a notable year over year increase in home loans, and which we expect to continue to provide benefits, while we expect overall home loans growth could be correlated with rate movements in 2024.\n",

      "Technology Platform segment contribution profit of $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 24% over 2022, and total net revenue of $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 12% over 2022. Growth was driven by continued strong organic growth of existing partners and new product adoption, as well as notable contributions from increasingly diversified clients which have launched within the second half of 2023. Margin improvements were driven primarily by Galileo account growth and decreases in directly attributable expenses, as we begin to realize the benefits of earlier investments made to support Technology Platform product development and the integration of Galileo and Technisys. The year over year comparison was also impacted by a partial period of contribution from Technisys in 2022 compared to a full period of contribution in 2023. We continue to make significant strides in our strategy of leveraging our unique product suite to pursue diversified growth and expansion via new products and geographies, in addition to larger, more durable revenue opportunities. We expect growth in segment revenue to continue to accelerate in 2024, as we are well positioned to capture opportunities from traditional financial institutions and nonfinancial categories. \n",
      "Within Financial Services, contribution loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 significantly improved compared to a contribution loss of $199.4 million in 2022, and reflected positive contribution profit during the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Total net revenue of $436.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 160% over 2022. We achieved continued strong growth in deposits, ending the year with $18.6 billion of deposits as of December 31, 2023, allowing us to maintain diversified sources of funding and driving an increase in net interest income earned on our deposits. In addition, we grew total Financial Services products by 45% year over year. We continue to realize scale in our marketing spend and improvement in operating leverage in the segment. We expect to continue to scale our products through increased brand awareness and network effects, and continue to improve contribution profit in the segment.\n",
      "The strength of our results underscores our belief that our suite of differentiated products and services provides the foundation for a diversified business that can endure through market cycles as well as exogenous factors. For instance, our access to multiple channels of funding, including deposit and loan warehouse funding, provides an advantage via increased optionality in sourcing liquidity through different environments and periods of capital markets volatility, as well as increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin and optimize returns, which typically provides more stable earnings in any macroeconomic environment but is particularly important during times of excess macroeconomic volatility. \n",
      "During 2023, we continued to have strong deposit contribution from direct deposit members with a high quality median FICO score. We expect that our funding mix will continue to move towards deposit funding, which has a lower borrowing cost of funds than our warehouse and securitization financing model. We also provided our members with access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage through a network of participating banks in our Insured Deposit Program, further enhancing our benefits offering to our members. Our total capital ratio, as calculated under applicable regulatory capital rules, was 15.3% as of December 31, 2023. See Note 21. Regulatory Capital to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n",

      "Net interest income, which we define as the difference between the earned interest income and interest expense to finance loans, is a key component of the profitability of our Lending segment. We implemented an FTP framework to attribute net interest income to our business segments based on their usage and/or provision of funding, under which Lending segment net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our loans and an FTP charge for the segment’s use of funds to originate loans, which can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates, funding curves, the composition of our balance sheet and the availability of capital.

Pricing structures under these contracts are typically volume-based, or a combination of activity and volume-based, and payment terms are predominantly monthly in arrears. Many of these contracts contain minimum monthly payments, which may result in credits if we do not meet the agreed upon monthly service levels. We also earn subscription and service fees for providing software licenses and associated services, including implementation, maintenance and subsequent development work. We charge a recurring subscription fee for the software license and related maintenance services. Other software-related services are billed on a periodic basis as the services are provided.

      "•Net interest income: Net interest income is a key component of the profitability of our Financial Services segment as it relates primarily to our SoFi Money and credit card products. Net interest income on SoFi Money is based on interest income determined using our FTP framework, net of interest expense based on the interest rate offered to our members on their deposits. Net interest income on credit card is based on the contractual interest included in credit card agreements, net of interest expense as determined using the FTP framework. See Note 20. Business Segment and Geographic Information to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the FTP framework. \n",
      "•Referral fees: Through strategic partnerships, we earn a specified referral fee in connection with referral activity we facilitate through our platform. Referral fees are paid to us by third-party partners that offer services to end users who do not use one of our product offerings, but who were referred to the partners through our platform. We also earn referral fulfillment fees for providing pre-qualified borrower referrals to a third-party partner who separately contracts with a loan originator. Our referral fee is calculated as either a fixed price per successful referral or a percentage of the transaction volume between the enterprise partners and referred consumers.\n",
      "•Interchange fees: We earn interchange fees from our SoFi-branded debit cards and credit cards. These fees are remitted by merchants and represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value processed through a payment network. We engage a card association and enter into contracts that establish the shared economics of SoFi-branded transaction cards.\n",
      "•Brokerage fees: We earn brokerage fees primarily from our share lending and payment for order flow arrangements related to our SoFi Invest product, in which we benefit through a negotiated multi-year revenue sharing arrangement, since our members' brokerage activity drives the share lending and payment for order flow volume. \n",

      "Our management and Board of Directors use adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, formulate business plans, help better assess our overall liquidity position and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. \n",
      "Adjusted Net Revenue\n",
      "Adjusted net revenue is defined as total net revenue, adjusted to exclude the fair value changes in servicing rights and residual interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions changes, which relate only to our Lending segment, as well as gains and losses on extinguishment of debt. We adjust total net revenue to exclude these items, as they are non-cash charges that are not realized during the period, and therefore positive or negative changes do not impact the cash available to fund our operations. This measure helps provide our management with an understanding of the net revenue available to finance our operations and helps management better decide on the proper expenses to authorize for each of our operating segments, to ultimately help achieve target contribution profit margins. Therefore, the measure of adjusted net revenue serves as both the starting point for how we think about the liquidity generated from our operations and also the starting point for our annual financial planning, the latter of which focuses on the cash we expect to generate from our operating segments to help fund the current year’s strategic objectives. Adjusted net revenue has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as total net revenue. The primary limitation of adjusted net revenue is its lack of comparability to other companies that do not utilize this measure or that use a similar measure that is defined in a different manner. \n",

      "(1)Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on servicing rights, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. These assumptions are highly sensitive to market interest rate changes and are not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Moreover, these non-cash charges are unrealized during the period and, therefore, have no impact on our cash flows from operations.

      "(2)Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on residual interests classified as debt, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. When third parties finance our consolidated securitization VIEs by purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the closing of the securitization and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These residual debt obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but they have no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. As such, these positive and negative non-cash changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations. \n",
      "(3)Reflects gain on extinguishment of debt. Gains and losses are recognized during the period of extinguishment for the difference between the net carrying amount of debt extinguished and the fair value of equity securities issued. These non-cash charges are not indicative of our core operating performance, and as such are adjusted out of total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations and our overall performance.\n",

We believe adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure to investors for period-over-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effects of certain non-cash items and certain charges that are not indicative of our core operating performance or results of operations. It is also a measure that management relies upon to evaluate cash flows generated from operations, and therefore the extent of additional capital, if any, required to invest in strategic initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net income (loss). Some of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA include that it does not reflect the impact of working capital requirements or capital expenditures and it is not a universally consistent calculation among companies in our industry, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n",

      "(1)Our adjusted EBITDA measure adjusts for corporate borrowing-based interest expense, as these expenses are a function of our capital structure. Corporate borrowing-based interest expense includes interest on our revolving credit facility and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on our convertible notes, and for 2021, interest on the seller note issued in connection with our acquisition of Galileo. Revolving credit facility interest expense in 2023 and 2022 increased due to higher interest rates relative to the prior years on identical outstanding debt. \n",
      "(2)Income taxes in 2023 were primarily attributable to income tax benefits from foreign losses in jurisdictions with net deferred tax liabilities related to Technisys, offset by income tax expense associated with the profitability of SoFi Bank in state jurisdictions where separate filings are required, as well as federal taxes where our tax credits and loss carryforwards may be limited. Income taxes in 2022 were primarily attributable to tax expense at SoFi Lending Corp and SoFi Bank due to profitability in state jurisdictions where separate filings are required and recognition of expense from Technisys in certain Latin American countries where separate returns are filed. The expense was partially offset by deferred tax benefits from the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Technisys Merger. Income taxes in 2021 were primarily attributable to the profitability of SoFi Lending Corp. profitability in state jurisdictions where separate filings are required. See Note 17. Income Taxes to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n",
      "(3)Depreciation and amortization expense in 2023 increased compared to 2022 primarily in connection with acquisitions and growth in our internally-developed software balance. The increase in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily in connection with acquisitions and growth in our software balance, partially offset by the acceleration of core banking infrastructure amortization during the 2021 period.\n",
      "(4)Restructuring charges in 2023 primarily included employee-related wages, benefits and severance associated with a small reduction in headcount in our Technology Platform segment in the first quarter of 2023 and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to a reduction in headcount across the Company, which do not reflect expected future operating expenses and are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n",
      "(5)Impairment expense in 2023 includes $247,174 related to goodwill impairment, and $1,243 related to a sublease arrangement, which are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n",
      "(6)Foreign currency charges reflect the impacts of highly inflationary accounting for our operations in Argentina, which are related to our Technology Platform segment and commenced in the first quarter of 2022 with the Technisys Merger. For the year ended December 31, 2023, all amounts were reflected in the fourth quarter, as inter-quarter amounts were determined to be immaterial. Amounts in 2022 were determined to be immaterial.\n",
      "(7)Transaction-related expenses in 2023 and 2022 primarily included financial advisory and professional services costs associated with our acquisitions of Wyndham and Technisys, respectively. Transaction-related expenses in 2021 included the special payment to the holders of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock in conjunction with the Business Combination and financial advisory and professional costs associated with our then-pending acquisitions of Golden Pacific and Technisys. \n",
      "(8)Our adjusted EBITDA measure excludes the non-cash fair value changes in warrants accounted for as liabilities, which were measured at fair value through earnings. The amount in 2021 related to changes in the fair value of Series H warrants issued by Social Finance in connection with certain redeemable preferred stock issuances. We did not measure the Series H warrants at fair value subsequent to May 28, 2021 in conjunction with the Business Combination, as they were reclassified into permanent equity. In addition, in conjunction with the Business Combination, SoFi Technologies assumed certain common stock warrants (“SoFi Technologies warrants”) that were accounted for as liabilities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of the SoFi Technologies warrants was based on the closing price of ticker SOFIW and, therefore, fluctuated based on market activity. The outstanding SoFi Technologies warrants were either exercised during the fourth quarter of 2021 or redeemed on December 6, 2021. \n",
      "(9)Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including market servicing costs, conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. This non-cash change is unrealized during the period and, therefore, has no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available to finance our operations. \n",

      "(10)Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. When third parties finance our consolidated VIEs through purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the securitization close and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which has no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. As such, these positive and negative non-cash changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available to finance our operations. \n",
      "(11)Reflects gain on extinguishment of debt. Gains and losses are recognized during the period of extinguishment for the difference between the net carrying amount of debt extinguished and the fair value of equity securities issued. These non-cash charges are not indicative of our core operating performance, and as such are adjusted out of total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations and our overall performance.\n",

We define a member as someone who has a lending relationship with us through origination and/or ongoing servicing, opened a financial services account, linked an external account to our platform or signed up for our credit score monitoring service. Our members have continuous access to our CFPs, our career advice services, our member events, our content, educational material, news, and our tools and calculators, which are provided at no cost to the member.

      "Once someone becomes a member, they are always considered a member unless they violate our terms of service. We adjust our total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service. This could occur for a variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, our grounds for removing members from our total member count could change. The determination that a member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant members and their associated products are removed from our total member count in the period in which such evaluation process concludes. However, depending on the length of the evaluation process, that removal may not take place in the same period in which the member was added to our member count or the same period in which the circumstances leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member count may not yet reflect adjustments that may be made once ongoing evaluation processes, if any, conclude.\n",
      "We view members as an indication not only of the size and a measurement of growth of our business, but also as a measure of the significant value of the data we have collected over time. The data we collect from our members helps us to, among other things: (i) assess loan life performance data on each loan in our ecosystem, which can inform risk-based interest rates that we can offer our members, (ii) understand our members’ spending behavior to identify and suggest other products we offer that may align with the members’ financial needs, and (iii) enhance our opportunities to sell additional products to our members, as our members represent a vital source of marketing opportunities. When we provide additional products to members, it helps improve our unit economics per member, as we save on marketing costs that we would otherwise incur to attract new members. It also increases the lifetime value of an individual member. This in turn enhances our Financial Services Productivity Loop. Member growth is generally an indicator of future revenue, but is not directly correlated with revenues, since not all members who sign up for one of our products fully utilize or continue to use our products, and not all of our products (such as our complimentary product, SoFi Relay) provide direct sources of revenue. \n",

      "Our future operating results and cash flows are dependent upon a number of opportunities, challenges and other factors, including our loan origination volume, financial services products and member activity on our platform, growth in technology platform clients, competition and industry trends, general economic conditions and our ability to optimize our national bank charter.\n",
      "Origination Volume \n",
      "Our Lending segment is our largest segment, comprising 65%, 72% and 75% of total net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We are dependent upon the addition of new members and new activity from existing members within our Lending segment to generate origination volume, which we believe is a contributor to Lending segment net revenue. We believe we have a high-quality loan portfolio, as indicated by our Lending segment weighted average origination FICO score of 749 during the year ended December 31, 2023. See “Industry Trends and General Economic Conditions” for the impact of specific economic factors on origination volume. \n",

      "Member Growth and Activity \n",
      "We have invested heavily in our platform and are dependent on continued member growth, as well as our ability to generate additional revenues from our existing members using additional products and services. Member growth and activity is critical to our ability to increase our scale and earn a return on our technology and product investments. Growth in members and member activity will depend heavily on our ability to continue to offer attractive products and services at sustainable costs and our continued member acquisition and marketing efforts. \n",
      "Product Growth \n",
      "Our aim is to develop and offer a best-in-class integrated financial services platform with products that meet the broad objectives of our members and the lifecycle of their financial needs. We have invested, and continue to invest, heavily in the development, improvement and marketing of our suite of lending and financial services products and are dependent on continued growth in the number of products selected by our members, as well as our ability to build trust and reliability between our members and our platform to reinforce the effects of the Financial Services Productivity Loop. In order to deliver on our strategy, we aim to foster positive member experiences designed to lead to more product adoption by existing members, leading to enhanced profitability for each additional product by lowering overall member acquisition costs. \n",
      "Galileo Account Growth \n",
      "Galileo primarily provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions, which enabled us to diversify our business from a primarily consumer-based business to also serve enterprises that rely upon Galileo’s integrated platform as a service to serve their clients. We are dependent on growth in the number of accounts at Galileo, which is an indication of the amount of users that are dependent upon the technology platform for a variety of products and services, including virtual card products, virtual wallets, peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank transfers, early paychecks and relying on real-time authorizations, all of which generate revenue for Galileo. \n",
      "SoFi Bank\n",
      "A key element of our long-term strategy has been to secure a national bank charter. In February 2022, we closed the Bank Merger and began operating Golden Pacific Bank as SoFi Bank. In connection with operating a national bank, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs primarily associated with headcount, technology infrastructure, governance, compliance and risk management, marketing, and other general and administrative expenses.\n",
      "See Part I, Item 1. “Company Overview—SoFi Bank” for a discussion of the key expected financial benefits to us of operating a national bank. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for discussion of certain potential risks related to being a bank holding company.\n",
      "Industry Trends and General Economic Conditions \n",
      "Our results of operations have historically been relatively resilient to economic downturns but in the future may be impacted by the relative strength of the overall economy and its effect on unemployment, asset markets and consumer spending. As general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, the amount of consumer disposable income tends to fluctuate, which in turn impacts consumer spending levels and the willingness of consumers to take out loans to finance purchases or invest in financial assets. Specific economic factors, such as interest rate levels, changes in monetary and related policies, unemployment rates, market volatility, consumer confidence and changing expectations for inflation and deflation, also influence consumer spending, saving, investing and borrowing patterns. \n",
      "The Federal Reserve increased the benchmark interest rate throughout 2022 and several times in 2023, largely in response to high inflation, low unemployment and strong consumer demand, while balancing macroeconomic risks, such as increased market volatility. We have continued to see strong demand for our deposits as a result of our competitive interest rate offering and access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage through a network of participating banks in our Insured Deposit Program. However, rising interest rates have unfavorably impacted, and could continue to unfavorably impact, demand for refinancing loan products. Economic and market volatility may continue to occur and could worsen, including if there is additional turmoil in the banking and financial services sectors, which could adversely impact our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. These market developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in the safety and soundness of certain banks. As a result, although we have not observed a decline in our overall deposits to date, our members may choose to maintain deposits with other financial institutions or spread their deposit funds among multiple financial institutions. In addition, if the Federal Reserve does not effectively curb inflation or interest rates further rise unexpectedly or too quickly or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or do not improve, it could have a negative impact on the overall economy and result in increased unemployment, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In 2023, we saw a continuation \n",

Our increased personal loan annualized charge-off rate year over year was reflective of our expectation of credit metrics to revert over time to more normalized levels, but remains healthy, while our higher credit card annualized charge-off rate was reflective of our maturing portfolio. Negative changes to macroeconomic conditions may result in decreased demand for our products, increased operating costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\n",
      "Fair Value of Loans\n",
      "We measure our personal loans, student loans and home loans at fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we transferred home loans out of Level 3 and into Level 2 due to an update to pricing sources utilized by third-party valuation specialists, as part of the integration of Wyndham. Other loans do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices and are classified as Level 3. \n",
      "Our fair value adjustments on loans impact our consolidated results of operations and include adjustments related to loans originated during the period, loans held at the balance sheet date, as well as gains (losses) on loans sold or repurchased during the period. Fair value adjustments made in each reporting period are impacted by factors such as, among others, interest rates, weighted average coupon, credit spreads, actual and estimated losses, prepayment speeds, duration and previous loan sale execution on similar loans. In determining our fair value assumptions, we incorporate recent data impacting the capital markets, as well as factors specific to us. Changes in these factors, either positive or negative, can have a material impact on our results of operations.\n",

      "•The weighted average discount rates on personal loans and student loans decreased by 103 bps and 57, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 compared to September 30, 2023. For personal loans, our discount rate assumptions decreased in the fourth quarter due to benchmark rates declining by 90 bps, as well as spreads tightening by 13 bps. For student loans, our discount rate assumptions decreased in the fourth quarter due to benchmark rates declining by 86 bps, as well as spreads widening by 29 bps. Spread changes are indicated by asset-backed security and secondary bond markets. \n",
      "•Annualized net charge-off rates on personal loans and student loans in the fourth quarter of 2023 were 3.98% and 0.59%, respectively, which remained lower than the assumed weighted average default rates in our fair value model of 4.76% and 0.61%, respectively. Our fair value assumption for annual default rate incorporates fair value markdowns on loans beginning when they are 10 days or more delinquent, with additional markdowns at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days past due. For instance, personal loans are marked down on average 70% when the loans are 30 days past due.\n",

Additionally, in August 2022, President Biden announced relief measures for federal student loan borrowers, including forgiveness of $10,000 of student loans (or up to $20,000 if student loans are Pell Grants) for anyone earning less than $125,000 annually and certain changes to income-driven repayment plans for student loans (the “Biden Forgiveness Program”). Although the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently struck down the Biden Forgiveness Program, President Biden indicated between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024, he would allow federal loan borrowers to not be considered delinquent if they miss a payment and that the U.S. Department of Education will not refer borrowers who fail to pay their student loan bills to credit agencies. In addition, on July 14, 2023, President Biden announced that $39 billion in federal student loan debt would be eliminated to remedy mistakes of loan servicers, and other student loan holders will have their loans adjusted. On October 4, 2023, the Biden Administration approved an additional 125,000 borrowers for student loan debt relief, totaling an additional $9 billion in student debt forgiveness.\n",
      "While we expect we may continue to see an increase in student loan refinancing volume following the end of the federal student loan payment moratorium after August 30, 2023, as borrowers may look to refinance at a lower rate or, given the high interest rate environment, may look to extend the loan term, the timing and impact to our student loan refinancing product will largely depend on expectations regarding the introduction or implementation of additional relief measures, the interest rate environment, how competitive our student loan refinancing products are compared to our competitors and macroeconomic factors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Net Interest Income\n",
      "Net interest income primarily reflects the excess of interest income earned on our loans over the interest expense incurred to fund such loans. Net interest income is impacted by loan origination volume, the level of securitization activity, the amount of time we hold loans on our consolidated balance sheet and the volume of member deposits, as well as prevailing interest rates, which impact the rates we receive on our loans and securitization-related investments in bonds and residual interest positions, and the rates we incur from our funding sources including our warehouse facilities, securitization debt and member deposits at SoFi Bank. We also incur interest expense related to our revolving credit facility, as well as on our convertible notes in the form of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. \n",
      "Noninterest Income \n",
      "Noninterest income primarily consists of: (i) revenue recognized from contracts with customers, which primarily relates to our technology products and solutions revenues and has grown due to our recent acquisitions and the growth and expansion of our financial services offerings, (ii) fair value changes in loans while we hold them on our consolidated balance sheet and our securitization activities, inclusive of our hedging activities, (iii) gains on sales of loans transferred into the securitization or whole loan sale channels, (iv) loan origination fees, whereby a borrower may optionally elect to pay origination fees to qualify for a lower annual percentage rate, (v) the income we receive from our loan servicing activities, as well as the assumption of servicing rights from third parties, (vi) gains and losses on non-securitization investments, and (vii) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt.\n",
      "Noninterest Expense \n",
      "Noninterest expense primarily relates to the following categories of expenses: (i) technology and product development, (ii) sales and marketing, (iii) cost of operations, and (iv) general and administrative. Certain costs are included within each of these line items, such as compensation and benefits-related expense (inclusive of share-based compensation expense), professional services, depreciation and amortization, and occupancy-related costs. We allocate certain costs to each of these categories based on department-level headcounts. We generally expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our business continues to grow. Noninterest expense also includes the provision for credit losses, which primarily relates to our credit card product, as well as goodwill impairment, related to the Galileo and Technisys reporting units.\n",

Total noninterest expense increased by $426.2 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by: (i) higher employee compensation and benefits (inclusive of an increase in share-based compensation expense), a portion of which was attributable to the Technisys Merger and the remainder of which was related to increased personnel to support our growth in 2022, (ii) increases in advertising expenditures and utilization of lead generation channels, (iii) an increase in the provision for credit losses, which reflected higher average credit card balances combined with elevated credit card loss rates during 2022, (iv) an increase in amortization of intangible assets due to acquired intangible assets in the Technisys Merger, and (v) an increase in purchased and internally-developed software amortization, reflective of continued investments in technology.\n",

      "Origination Volume \n",
      "We refer to the aggregate dollar amount of loans originated through our platform in a given period as origination volume. Origination volume is an indicator of the size and health of our Lending segment and an indicator (together with the relevant loan characteristics, such as interest rate and prepayment and default expectations) of revenues and profitability. Changes in origination volume are driven by the addition of new members and existing members, the latter of which at times will either refinance into a new SoFi loan or secure an additional, concurrent loan, as well as macroeconomic factors impacting consumer spending and borrowing behavior. Since the profitability of the Lending segment is largely correlated with origination volume, management relies on origination volume trends to assess the need for external financing to support the Financial Services segment and the expense budgets for unallocated expenses. \n",
      "Personal Loans. During the year ended December 31, 2023, personal loan origination volume increased significantly relative to 2022, primarily due to increased demand driven by expanded marketing efforts and increased demand for debt consolidation products in a rising interest rate environment.\n",
      "Personal loan origination volume increased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased demand driven by expanded marketing efforts and increased demand for debt consolidation products in a rising interest rate environment. This was combined with a positive impact from increased loan application approval rates within our existing credit parameters that were implemented during the second half of 2021 and maintained through mid-2022, with slight credit tightening implemented in the second half of 2022. \n",
      "Student Loans.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, student loan origination volume increased relative to 2022, as demand for student loan refinancing products increased ahead of the resumption of principal and interest payments on federally-held student loans as borrowers looked to refinance at a lower rate or, given the high interest rate environment, to extend the loan term. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the suspension of principal and interest payments on federally-held student loans through August 30, 2023 and the expectation of debt cancellation for certain federal student loan borrowers which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023, combined with a continued rising interest rate environment in 2023.\n",
      "Student loan origination volume decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, as demand for student loan refinancing products continued to be unfavorably impacted by the ongoing suspension of principal and interest payments on federally-held student loans and the expectation of debt cancellation for certain federal student loan borrowers, combined with a rising interest rate environment in 2022. \n",
      "Home Loans.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, home loan origination volume remained relatively flat relative to 2022 due to continued rising interest rates, which tends to lower demand for home loans overall and shift demand from refinance originations to purchase originations, the latter of which is a more competitive landscape. Although purchase originations historically represented a smaller percentage of our home loan originations, our mix during the 2023 period has shifted toward more purchase originations, which we would expect to continue under similar macroeconomic conditions. Our home loan origination volume increased notably beginning in the second quarter of 2023, aided by the increased capacity and capabilities subsequent to our acquisition of Wyndham.\n",

      "Loans with a Balance and Average Loan Balance \n",
      "Loans with a balance refers to the number of loans that have a balance greater than zero dollars as of the reporting date. Loans with a balance allows management to better understand the unit economics of acquiring a loan in relation to the lifetime value of that loan. Average loan balance is defined as the total unpaid principal balance of the loans divided by loans with a balance within the respective loan product category as of the reporting date. Average loan balance tends to fluctuate based on the pace of loan originations relative to loan repayments and the initial loan origination size.\n",

As such, this non-cash change in fair value is adjusted to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the cash flows available to finance our operations.\n",

The amount of financing actually advanced on each individual loan under our loan warehouse facilities, as determined by agreed-upon advance rates, may be less than the stated advance rate depending, in part, on changes in underlying loan characteristics of the loans securing the financings. Each of our loan warehouse facilities allows the lender providing the funds to evaluate the market value of the loans that are serving as collateral for the borrowings or advances being made. The amount owed and outstanding on our loan warehouse facilities fluctuates significantly based on our origination volume, sales volume, the amount of time we strategically hold loans on our balance sheet, and the amount of loans being funded with our cash or member deposits. \n",
      "In October 2021, we closed on the issuance of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the “convertible notes”), which do not bear regular interest, will mature in October 2026 (unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted) and will be convertible by the noteholders beginning in April 2026 under certain circumstances. In December 2023, the Company entered into agreements to repurchase $88.0 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes, for which the Company issued 9,490,000 shares of common stock to settle. Following these repurchases, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes remain outstanding. Redemption events and conversion events (to the extent we elect to cash settle) could require a material use of cash at the time of the event. See Note 12. Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the conversion, settlement and redemption terms of the convertible notes. Additionally, if special interest or additional interest is incurred on the convertible notes, it could require an additional use of cash.\n",
      "In connection with the issuance of the convertible notes, we entered into privately negotiated Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilutive effect on the common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be. Refer to Note 13. Equity for additional information on the Capped Call Transactions. All of these transactions are expected to remain in effect notwithstanding the December 2023 repurchases.\n",
      "The net proceeds from the October 2021 convertible debt issuance were $1.2 billion. We used $113.8 million of the net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into the Capped Call Transactions. We allotted the remainder of the net proceeds to pay related expenses and for general corporate purposes.\n",
      "Covenants\n",
      "We have various affirmative and negative financial covenants, as well as non-financial covenants, related to our warehouse debt and revolving credit facility, as well as our Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock. Additionally, we have compliance requirements associated with our convertible notes, and certain provisions of the arrangement could change in the event of a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change”, as defined in the indenture governing such convertible notes.\n",
      "The availability of funds under our warehouse facilities and revolving credit facility is subject to, among other conditions, our continued compliance with the covenants. These financial covenants include, but are not limited to, maintaining: (i) a certain minimum tangible net worth, (ii) minimum unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, (iii) a maximum leverage ratio of total debt to tangible net worth, and (iv) minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. A breach of these covenants can result in an event of default under these facilities and allows the lenders to pursue certain remedies. See Note 12. Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our subsidiaries are restricted in the amount that can be distributed to SoFi only to the extent that such distributions would cause the financial covenants to not be met.\n",
      "In addition, pursuant to our amended and restated agreement related to our Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, we are subject to the following financial covenants:\n",
      "•Tangible net worth to total debt ratio requirement, which excludes our warehouse, risk retention and securitization related debt;\n",
      "•Tangible net worth to Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock ratio requirement; and\n",
      "•Minimum excess equity requirements, where the measure of equity includes permanent equity and SoFi Technologies Redeemable Preferred Stock (exclusive of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock), as applicable. \n",

      "SoFi Technologies, a bank holding company, and SoFi Bank, a nationally chartered association, are required to comply with regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and FDIC. From time to time, we may contribute capital to SoFi Bank. We are required to manage our capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and support our business activities, including the requirement to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standardized approach for U.S. banking organizations (U.S. Basel III). If the Federal Reserve finds that we are not “well-capitalized” or “well-managed”, we would be required to take remedial action, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. \n",
      "These requirements establish required minimum ratios for CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and a Tier 1 leverage ratio; set risk-weighting for assets and certain other items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements.\n",
      "As of December 31, 2023, our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the thresholds required to be regarded as a well-capitalized institution, and meet all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. There have been no events or conditions since December 31, 2023 that management believes would change the categorization. See Note 21.

Similarly, contractual obligations exclude securitization debt, as the maturity of the notes issued by the various trusts occurs upon either the maturity of the loan collateral or full payment of the loan collateral held in the trusts, the timing of which cannot be reasonably estimated. Additionally, our own liquidity resources are not required to make any contractual payments on these borrowings, except in limited instances associated with our guarantee arrangements. Our maturity date represents the legal maturity of the last class of maturing notes. See Note 18. Commitments, Guarantees, Concentrations and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our guarantees. Finally, contractual obligations exclude the impact of uncertain tax positions, as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of such future cash flows. See Note 17.

      "Guarantees\n",
      "We may require liquidity resources associated with our guarantee arrangements. As a component of our loan sale agreements, we make certain representations to third parties that purchased our previously held loans. We have a three-year obligation to GSEs on loans that we sell to GSEs, to repurchase any originated loans that do not meet certain GSE guidelines, \n",
      "SoFi Technologies, Inc.\n",
      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "and we are required to pay the full initial purchase price back to the GSEs. In addition, we make standard representations and warranties related to personal, student and home loan transfers, as well as limited credit-related repurchase guarantees on certain such transfers. If realized, any of the repurchases would require the use of cash. See Note 18. Commitments, Guarantees, Concentrations and Contingencies to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these and other guarantee obligations. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet these expected obligations.\n",
      "Factors Affecting Liquidity\n",
      "We are currently dependent on the success of our lending business. The primary drivers of operating cash flows related to our Lending segment are origination volume, the holding period of our loans, loan sale execution and the timing of loan repayments. Our ability to access whole loan buyers, to sell our loans on favorable terms, to maintain adequate warehouse capacity at favorable terms, to access new deposits and grow existing deposits and to strategically manage our continuing financial interest in securitization-related transfers is critical to our growth strategy and our ability to have adequate liquidity to fund our balance sheet. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits can be impacted by, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the banking sector (such as bank failures or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risks), competition from other financial services firms, idiosyncratic events and the interest rates we offer, which can impact our liquidity from deposits. Through 2023, we continued to have strong deposit contribution. During 2023, we also provided our members with access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage through a network of participating banks in our Insured Deposit Program. \n",
      "There is no guarantee that we will be able to execute on our strategy as it relates to the timing and pricing of securitization-related transfers. Therefore, we may hold securitization interests for longer than planned or be forced to liquidate at suboptimal prices. Securitization transfers are also negatively impacted during recessionary periods, wherein purchasers may be more risk averse.\n",
      "Further, future uncertainties around the demand for our personal loans, home loans and around the student loan refinance market in general, including as a result of worsening macroeconomic conditions or continued turmoil in the banking and financial services sectors, should be considered when assessing our future liquidity and solvency prospects. In the future, our loan origination volume and our resulting loan balances, and any positive cash flows thereof, could also be lower based on strategic decisions to tighten our credit standards. \n",
      "In addition to our ability to pledge unencumbered loans against available warehouse capacity, we have relationships with whole loan buyers who have historically demonstrated strong demand for our loans. Securitization markets can also generate additional liquidity; however, financing through the securitization market could result in worse execution as compared to whole loans sales depending on market conditions and, in certain cases, we are required to maintain a minimum investment due to securitization risk retention rules.\n",
      "Additionally, our securitization transactions require us to maintain a continuing financial interest in the form of securitization investments when we deconsolidate the SPE or in consolidation of the SPE when we have a significant financial interest. In either instance, the continuing financial interest requires us to maintain capital in the SPE that would otherwise be available to us if we had sold loans through a different channel. As it relates to our securitization debt, the maturity of the notes issued by the various trusts occurs upon either the maturity of the loan collateral or full payment of the loan collateral held in the trusts, the timing of which cannot be reasonably estimated. Our own liquidity resources are not required to make any contractual payments on our securitization borrowings.\n",
      "Our cash flows from operations have also historically been impacted by material net losses. While we achieved net income profitability for the first time during the fourth quarter of 2023, changing business, macroeconomic or other conditions could potentially lead us, in the future, to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt, which may not be at favorable terms when compared to previous financing transactions.\n",
      "Our long-term liquidity strategy includes continuing to grow our deposit base, maintaining adequate warehouse capacity, maintaining corporate debt and other sources of financing, as well as effectively managing the capital raised through debt and equity transactions. Although our goal is to increase our cash flow from operations, there can be no assurance that our future operating plans will lead to improved operating cash flows. \n",
      "The FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” See Part I, Item 1. “Government Supervision and Regulation—Brokered Deposits” for additional information. As of December 31, 2023, our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the thresholds required to be regarded as a well-capitalized institution, and meet all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject.\n",

      "Other Arrangements \n",
      "We enter into arrangements in which we originate loans, establish an SPE and transfer loans to the SPE, which has historically served as an important source of liquidity. We also retain the servicing rights of the underlying loans and hold additional interests in the SPE. When an SPE is determined not to be a VIE or when an SPE is determined to be a VIE but we are not the primary beneficiary, the SPE is not consolidated. In addition, a significant change to the pertinent rights of other parties or our pertinent rights, or a significant change to the ranges of possible financial performance outcomes used in our assessment of the variability of cash flows due to us, could impact the determination of whether or not a VIE is consolidated. VIE consolidation and deconsolidation may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and impact period-over-period comparability. See Note 1. Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our VIE consolidation policy. \n",
      "Historically, we have established personal loan trusts and student loan trusts that were created and designed to transfer credit and interest rate risk associated with the underlying loans through the issuance of collateralized notes and residual certificates. We hold a variable interest in the trusts through our ownership of collateralized notes in the form of asset-backed bonds and residual certificates. The residual certificates absorb variability and represent the equity ownership interest in the equity portion of the personal loan and student loan trusts. \n",
      "We are also the servicer for all trusts in which we hold a financial interest. Although we have the power as servicer to perform the activities that most impact the economic performance of the VIE, we do not hold a significant financial interest in the trusts and, therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary. Further, we do not provide financial support beyond our initial equity investment, and our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with nonconsolidated VIEs is limited to our investment. For a more detailed discussion of nonconsolidated VIEs, including related activity during the year, see Note 7.

      "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n",
      "\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as revenues and expenses. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, particularly those that include the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain. See Note 1. Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. The most significant judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the critical accounting policies, which are discussed in detail below. We evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changes in market conditions or factors specific to us. \n",
      "Fair Value \n",
      "Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires us to use observable inputs when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The three levels are defined as follows: \n",
      "•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\n",
      "•Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or observable inputs other than quoted prices. \n",
      "•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which there is little or no market data, which requires us to develop our own assumptions. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, or similar techniques, which incorporate management’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n",
      "A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Instruments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. Our involvement with VIEs and origination of personal loans, student loans and home loans results in Level 2 and Level 3 assumptions having a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, as further discussed below. We utilize third-party valuation specialists to perform a valuation of these Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments on a monthly basis with quarterly oversight by a Valuation Working Group established by the Company that comprises leaders across finance, capital markets and accounting.\n",
      "Loans\n",
      "We elected the fair value option to measure our personal loans and student loans, as we believe that fair value best reflects the expected economic performance of the loans. These loans do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, and are classified as Level 3 because the valuations utilize significant unobservable inputs. \n",
      "We determine the fair value of our loans using a DCF calculation, which is a form of the income approach, while also considering market data as it becomes available. In applying the DCF methodology, we estimate the future cash flows of each loan portfolio using key loan metrics, such as term, vintage, coupon rate, coupon type and current balance, among others. The significant assumptions used in the valuation model include conditional prepayment rate, annual default rate and discount rate. The conditional prepayment rate represents the monthly annualized proportion of the principal of a pool of loans that is assumed to be paid off prematurely in each period. The annual default rate represents the annualized rate of borrowers who do \n",

      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "not make loan payments on time. The conditional prepayment and annual default rate assumptions are determined using company-specific historical loan performance curves. The discount rate represents the weighted average rate at which the expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at the net present value of the loans. The discount rate is determined based on company-specific factors and market observations, including underlying benchmark rates, our weighted average coupon rate and expected duration of the assets, the last of which is also impacted by expected prepayment rates. We also consider the volume and terms of recent whole loan sales and securitization market pricing factors, as applicable, as indicators of loan fair values.\n",
      "Securitizations\n",
      "Loans in consolidated VIEs remain on our consolidated balance sheet and are measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs in a manner consistent with our non-securitization loans. Moreover, third-party residual claims on these loans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are presented as residual interests classified as debt in our consolidated balance sheet. We classify the residual interests classified as debt as Level 3 due to the reliance on significant unobservable valuation inputs. In Company-sponsored securitization transactions that meet the applicable criteria to be accounted for as a sale, we retain certain asset-backed bonds, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs, and residual investments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. These risk retention interests in nonconsolidated VIEs are referred to as securitization investments. \n",
      "We determine the fair value of our residual interests classified as debt and our securitization investments using a DCF calculation, while also considering market data as it becomes available. In applying the DCF methodology, we estimate the future collateral cash flows using key securitization portfolio metrics, such as contractual payments and delinquency profile, among others. The significant assumptions used in the valuation model include conditional prepayment rate, annual default rate and discount rate. The conditional prepayment and annual default rate assumptions are determined using observed prepayment and default performance. The discount rate is determined based on market observations, such as secondary trading information, newly closed deals, benchmark rates and spread index, among others.\n",
      "See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for discussion of the sensitivity of our financial instruments measured at fair value to changes in various market risks. \n",
      "Business Combinations\n",
      "We account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, and which are typically determined in consultation with an independent appraiser. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, could significantly impact the consolidated financial statements in periods after the acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. \n",
      "Management uses significant judgment to determine the fair value of intangible assets. For developed technology, management applies the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method, which is a form of the income approach, for which the significant assumptions generally include expected earnings attributable to the asset (including an assumed technology migration curve), contributory asset charges and an assumed discount rate. For customer-related intangibles, management applies the With and Without Method, which is a form of the income approach, for which the significant assumptions generally include estimated annual revenues and net cash flows (including revenue ramp-up periods and customer attrition rates), and an assumed discount rate. For trade names, trademark and domain names, management applies the Relief from Royalty Method, which is a form of the income approach, for which the significant assumptions generally include expected earnings attributable to the asset, the probability of use of the asset, the royalty rate and an assumed discount rate. The assumed discount rates across the valuation methods reflect the risk of the asset relative to the overall risk of the acquired business. Definite-lived intangible assets are straight-line amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not recognize any impairment of definite-lived intangible assets.\n",
      "The excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The results of operations for each acquisition are included in our consolidated financial results beginning on the respective acquisition date. \n",

      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",

      "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the allocation of purchase consideration and to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to the extent that additional information becomes available. After this period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "Goodwill\n",
      "Goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of $1.4 billion, of which $17.7 million was recognized during the year in connection with business combinations. \n",
      "Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, with a recurring testing date of October 1, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. We may assess goodwill for impairment initially based on qualitative considerations, referred to as “step zero”, to determine whether conditions exist that indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis, referred to as step one, will be performed to determine if there is any impairment. We may alternatively elect to initially perform a quantitative assessment and bypass the qualitative assessment. Quantitative goodwill impairment assessments require a significant amount of management judgment, and a meaningful change in the forecasted future revenues and cash flows, the discount rate, and the determination of market multiples used in testing goodwill for impairment could result in a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.\n",
      "A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Therefore, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. Our reporting units for our goodwill impairment analysis represent components of our business at one level below our operating segments.\n",
      "An interim test is performed when events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. During the third quarter of 2023, the Technology Platform segment continued to experience slower growth rates than expected at the time of acquisition due to: (i) the uncertain macroeconomic environment, which has continued to impact customer spend volume, and (ii) continued longer sales cycles as a result of our shift in strategy to focus on diversified durable growth driven by potential new partners with scaled customer bases and interest in multiple Technology Platform products. These factors constituted a triggering event for goodwill testing purposes. As a result, we performed an interim quantitative test on the Galileo and Technisys reporting units to determine the existence and magnitude of potential goodwill impairment. We determined it was not necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for our other reporting units.\n",
      "During the third quarter of 2023, management calculated the fair value amount of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units using a combination of a DCF calculation, which is a form of the income approach, and a market multiples calculation, which is a form of the market approach. The discount rates used for the Galileo and Technisys reporting units in our interim quantitative assessment were 14.0% and 23.5%, respectively. The higher discount rate at Technisys was primarily driven by macroeconomic factors in Latin America, specifically the highly inflationary economic environment in Argentina. Additionally, management applied a terminal year long-term growth rate of 3.5% to both reporting units, consistent with previous quantitative assessments. As a result of this assessment, the fair value of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units were determined to be below their carrying values by 9.9% and 14.8%, respectively, resulting in management recognizing non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $124.5 million and $122.7 million for the Galileo and Technisys reporting units, respectively. If the discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the fair value of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units would decrease or increase by 6% and 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the fair value of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units would increase or decrease by approximately 3% and 1%, respectively.\n",
      "In performing the qualitative assessments of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2023, the Company evaluated events and circumstances since the last quantitative goodwill assessments to determine if it was not more likely than not that our goodwill was not impaired as of our annual impairment testing date. The factors evaluated included an assessment of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, key financial metrics, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, or any other specific events or changes. After assessing the relevant events and circumstances, we concluded it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value as of our annual impairment assessment date.\n",

      "Management cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the value of goodwill.

We broadly define these areas of risk as interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and operational risk. Historically, substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses were denominated in United States dollars. We may in the future be subject to increasing foreign currency exchange rate risk with our acquisition of a foreign company. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that our financial position or results of operations could be positively or negatively impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.

      "We are exposed to the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in market discount rates or overall market conditions, such as instability in the banking and financial services sectors. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our loans, securitization investments (including residual investments and asset-backed bonds), servicing rights and investments in AFS debt securities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a discounted cash flow methodology in which the discount rate represents an estimate of the required rate of return by market participants. Our loans with variable interest rates are exposed to interest rate volatility, which impacts the amount of recognized interest income. Our securitization residual investments are carried at fair value, which is subject to changes in market value by virtue of the impact of interest rates on the market yield of the residual investments. The value and earnings of our asset-backed bonds, which are associated with our personal loans and student loans, have a converse relationship to the movement of interest rates. That is, as interest rates rise, bond values and earnings fall and vice versa. Additionally, we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable-rate warehouse facilities and our revolving credit facility. Market interest rates may also drive the interest we offer to members on their deposits. Future funding activities may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, as the interest rates payable on such funding may be tied to SOFR or another representative alternative reference rate. We are also exposed to market risk through our investments in equity securities, which are either measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient or which may have positive or negative adjustments that impact our results of operations resulting from observable price changes based on current market conditions.\n",
      "Interest rate risk also occurs in periods where changes in short-term interest rates result in loans being originated with terms that provide a smaller interest rate spread above the financing terms of our warehouse facilities or above the interest rate we offer on deposits, which can negatively impact our realized net interest income. We utilize simulations to evaluate changes in net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The sensitivity is defined as the changes in net interest income relative to the baseline forecast.\n",

The net interest income sensitivities are applied to our 12 month forecast, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates, contractual cash flows, repricing characteristics, and our projected business activity, including deposit forecasts as a key assumption.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n",
      "We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n",
      "Basis for Opinion \n",
      "These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n",
      "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "Critical Audit Matters\n",
      "The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n",
      "Loans at fair value— Refer to Notes 1, 4, and 15 to the financial statements\n",
      "Critical Audit Matter Description\n",
      "The Company has elected the fair value option to measure personal and student loans, which are classified as Level 3 instruments because the valuations utilize significant unobservable inputs. The Company determines the fair value of the loans using a discounted cash flow calculation, which is a form of the income approach, while also considering market data as it becomes available. Management estimates the future cash flows of each loan portfolio using key loan metrics and significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable assumptions used in the valuation model include conditional prepayment rate, annual default rate and discount rate.\n",
      "We identified certain personal and student loans at fair value, as a critical audit matter because of the unobservable inputs management uses to estimate fair value. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\n",
      "How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n",
      "Our audit procedures related to the fair value measurement of the personal and student loans included the following, among others:\n",

      "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n",

      "•We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the fair value of personal and student loans, including management’s controls over the evaluation of the reasonableness of unobservable inputs used in the valuation.\n",
      "•We tested the completeness and accuracy of the source information derived from the Company’s loan data, which is used in the valuation model.\n",
      "•We evaluated the valuation models and the related assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs, and underlying loan data used by management.\n",
      "•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent fair value estimates of certain personal and student loans at fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates.\n",
      "Goodwill — Galileo and Technisys Reporting Units - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements\n",
      "Critical Audit Matter Description\n",
      "The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) calculation, which is a form of the income approach, and a market multiples calculation, which is a form of the market approach. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future revenues and cash flows, the discount rate, and the determination of market multiples. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company performed an interim quantitative assessment on the Galileo and Technisys reporting units. As a result of this assessment, the fair value of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units were determined to be below their carrying values by 9.9% and 14.8%, respectively, resulting in management recognizing goodwill impairment charges of $124.5 million and $122.7 million for the Galileo and Technisys reporting units, respectively. \n",
      "We identified the Company’s interim quantitative assessment performed on the Galileo and Technisys reporting units as a critical audit matter because of certain significant estimates and assumptions made by management to estimate the fair values of these reporting units. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasted future revenues and cash flows, the discount rate, and the determination of market multiples, specifically due to the sensitivity of the fair value and the goodwill impairment charge to changes in the assumptions.\n",
      "How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n",
      "Our audit procedures related to the significant estimates and assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the Galileo and Technisys reporting units used in the interim quantitative assessment included the following, among others:\n",
      "•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's interim quantitative impairment assessment, including those controls related to management’s forecast of future revenues and cash flows, selection of discount rates and determination of market multiples. \n",
      "•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and the key assumptions used in the assessment, including the selection of discount rates for which we tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the discount rate selected by management. For the determination of market multiples, our specialist evaluated the peer set utilized, the selection and calculation of the multiples, and weighting of the multiples.\n",
      "•We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues and cash flows by (1) understanding management’s process for developing their forecasts, and (2) comparing the forecasts to historical results, projections utilized in the prior year goodwill impairment analysis, and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group.\n",

      "Basis of Presentation \n",
      "The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain consolidated VIEs. All intercompany accounts were eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\n",
      "In our consolidated financial statements, we made the following presentation changes in 2023:\n",
      "•in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, (i) combined the financial statement line items for interest income—loans and interest income—securitizations and presented within interest income—loans and securitizations; and \n",
      "•in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, (i) combined the financial statement line items for noninterest income—loan origination and sales and noninterest income—securitizations and presented within noninterest income—loan origination, sales and securitizations.\n",
      "In all instances, the respective prior period amounts were recast to conform to the current period presentation.\n",
      "Use of Judgments, Assumptions and Estimates \n",
      "The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective in nature and, therefore, actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) fair value measurements, (ii) business combinations, and (iii) goodwill.\n",

      "Business Combinations\n",
      "We account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, which are measured in accordance with fair value measurement accounting principles. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature. The excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. \n",
      "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the allocation of purchase consideration and to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to the extent that additional information becomes available. After this period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "Variable Interest Entities \n",
      "We enter into arrangements in which we originate loans, establish a SPE, and transfer loans to the SPE. We retain the servicing rights of those loans and hold additional interests in the SPE. We evaluate each such arrangement to determine whether we have a variable interest. If we determine that we have a variable interest in an SPE, we then determine whether the SPE is a VIE. If the SPE is a VIE, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, such that we must consolidate the VIE on our consolidated balance sheets. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we identify the most significant activities and determine who has the power over those activities, and who absorbs the variability in the economics of the VIE. \n",
      "We periodically reassess our involvement with each VIE in which we have a variable interest. We monitor matters related to our ability to control economic performance, such as management of the SPE and its underlying loans, contractual changes in the services provided, the extent of our ownership, and the rights of third parties to terminate us as the VIE servicer. In addition, we monitor the financial performance of each VIE for indications that we may or may not have the right to absorb benefits or the obligation to absorb losses associated with variability in the financial performance of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE, which we define as a variable interest of greater than 10%. \n",
      "A significant change to the pertinent rights of us or other parties, or a significant change to the ranges of possible financial performance outcomes used in our assessment of the variability of cash flows due to us, could impact the determination of whether or not a VIE should be consolidated in future periods. VIE consolidation and deconsolidation may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and impact period-over-period comparability. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with consolidated VIEs is limited to our investment, which is eliminated in consolidation. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other commitments by third parties that may affect the fair value or risk of our variable interests in consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 7. Securitization and Variable Interest Entities for more details regarding our consolidated VIEs.\n",
      "Fair Value Measurements \n",
      "Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires us to use observable inputs when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The three levels are defined as follows: \n",
      "•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\n",
      "•Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or observable inputs other than quoted prices. \n",
      "•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which there is little or no market data, which requires us to develop our own assumptions. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted \n",

      "cash flow models, or similar techniques, which incorporate management’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n",
      "A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Instruments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. As a result, the related gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in Note 15. Fair Value Measurements may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. We utilize third-party valuation specialists to perform a valuation of these Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments on a monthly basis with quarterly oversight by a Valuation Working Group established by the Company that comprises leaders across finance, capital markets and accounting.\n",
      "Transfers of Financial Assets \n",
      "The transfer of an entire financial asset is accounted for as a sale if all of the following conditions are met: \n",
      "•the financial asset is isolated from the transferor and its consolidated affiliates as well as its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; \n",
      "•the transferee or beneficial interest holders have the right to pledge or exchange the transferred financial asset; and \n",
      "•the transferor, its consolidated affiliates and its agents do not maintain effective control over the transferred financial asset. \n",
      "Loan sales are aggregated in the financial statements due to the similarity of both the loans transferred and servicing arrangements. The portion of our income relating to ongoing servicing and the fair value of our servicing rights are dependent upon the performance of the sold loans. We measure the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets as the net assets received from the sale less the carrying amount of the loans sold. The net assets received from the sale represent the fair value of any assets obtained or liabilities incurred as part of the transaction, including but not limited to cash, servicing assets, retained securitization investments and recourse obligations. \n",
      "When securitizing loans, we employ a two-step transaction that includes the isolation of the underlying loans in a trust and the sale of beneficial interests in the trust to a bankruptcy-remote entity. Transfers of financial assets that do not qualify for sale accounting are reported as secured borrowings. Accordingly, the related assets remain on our consolidated balance sheets and continue to be reported and accounted for as if the transfer had not occurred. Cash proceeds received from these transfers are reported as liabilities, with related interest expense recognized over the life of the related secured borrowing. \n",
      "As a component of the loan sale agreements, we make certain representations to third parties that purchase our previously-held loans, some of which include GSE repurchase requirements and all of which are standard in nature and do not constrain our ability to recognize a sale for accounting purposes. Any significant estimated post-sale obligations or contingent obligations to the purchaser of the loans arising from these representations are accrued if probable and estimable. We establish a loan repurchase liability, which is based on historical experience and any current developments which would make it probable that we would buy back loans previously sold to third parties at the historical sales price. The loan repurchase liability is presented within accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, with the corresponding charges recorded within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents \n",
      "Cash and cash equivalents primarily include unrestricted deposits with financial institutions in checking, money market and short-term certificate of deposit accounts and certain short-term commercial paper. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n",
      "Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents \n",
      "Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents primarily include cash deposits, certificate of deposit accounts held on reserve, money market funds held by consolidated VIEs and collection balances. These accounts are earmarked as restricted because the balances are either member balances held in our custody, cash segregated for regulatory purposes associated with brokerage activities, escrow requirements for certain debt facilities and derivative agreements, deposits required by various bank holding companies we partner with (“Member Banks”) that support one or more of our products, loan collection balances \n",

      "Loans \n",
      "Loan Classification\n",
      "We classify loans as held for sale or held for investment based on management’s assessment of its intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity, which may change over time. A loan that is initially designated as held for sale or held for investment may be reclassified when our intent for that loan changes. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification and whether we elect the fair value option. The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management’s intent at origination. Cash flows related to loans that are originated with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans that are originated with the intent to hold for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n",
      "Our loan portfolio primarily consists of: (i) personal loans, student loans and home loans, which are measured at fair value and held for sale or held for investment, and (ii) senior secured loans, credit cards, and commercial and consumer banking loans, which are measured at amortized cost and held for investment. The commercial and consumer banking portfolio is primarily inclusive of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate and other consumer loans.\n",
      "Loans Measured at Fair Value\n",
      "We elected the fair value option to measure our personal loans, student loans and home loans, as we believe that fair value best reflects the expected economic performance of the loans. Therefore, these loans are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we transferred home loans out of Level 3 and into Level 2 due to an update to pricing sources utilized by third-party valuation specialists, as part of the integration of Wyndham. Other loans do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices and are classified as Level 3. We determine the fair value of our loans using a discounted cash flow methodology, while also considering market data as it becomes available. \n",
      "Direct fees, which primarily relate to personal and home loan originations, are recognized in earnings as earned and are recorded within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Direct loan origination costs are recognized in earnings as incurred and are recorded within noninterest expense—cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We record the initial fair value measurement and subsequent measurement changes in fair value in the period in which the changes occur within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We record cash flows related to loans held for sale within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n",
      "Securitized loans are assets held by consolidated SPEs as collateral for bonds issued, for which fair value changes are recorded within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Gains or losses recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE are also recorded within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations. \n",
      "We consider a loan to be delinquent when the borrower has not made the scheduled payment amount within one day after the scheduled payment date, provided the borrower is not in school or in deferment, forbearance or within an agreed-upon grace period. Loan deferment is a provision within student loan contracts that permits the borrower to defer payments while enrolled at least half time in school. During the deferment period, interest accrues on the loan balance and is capitalized to the loan when the loan enters repayment status, which begins when the student no longer qualifies for deferment.\n",
      "Forbearance applies to student loans, personal loans and home loans. A borrower in repayment may generally request forbearance for reasons including a FEMA-declared disaster, unemployment, economic hardship or general economic uncertainty. Forbearance typically cannot exceed a total of 12 months over the life of the loan. If forbearance is granted, interest continues to accrue during the forbearance period and is capitalized to the loan when the borrower resumes making payments. At the conclusion of a forbearance period, the contractual monthly payment is recalculated and is generally higher as a result.\n",

      "For personal loans and student loans, delinquent loans are charged off after 120 days of delinquency or on the date of confirmed loss. For home loans, delinquent loans are charged off after 180 days of delinquency or on the date of confirmed loss. For all loans, we stop accruing interest and reverse all accrued but unpaid interest on the date of charge-off. Additional information about our loans held for sale is included in Note 4. Loans, Note 7. Securitization and Variable Interest Entities and Note 15. Fair Value Measurements. \n",
      "Loans Measured at Amortized Cost\n",
      "For our senior secured and commercial and consumer banking loans, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the loans within interest income—loans and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining balance of deferred costs was immaterial.\n",
      "We present accrued interest for loans measured at amortized cost within loans held for investment, at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost of these loans is subject to our allowance for credit losses methodology described within “Allowance for Credit Losses” herein. We record cash flows related to loans held for investment within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n",
      "Credit card receivables are reported at the amounts due from members, including accrued interest and fees, and unamortized net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period as adjustments to income through interest income—loans and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Credit card balances are reported as delinquent when they become 30 or more days past due. Credit card balances are charged off after 180 days of delinquency or on the date of the confirmed loss, at which time we stop accruing interest and fees and reverse all accrued but unpaid interest and fees through interest income as of such date. When a credit card balance is charged off, we record a reduction to the allowance and the credit card balance. When recovery payments are received against charged off credit card balances, we record a direct reduction to the provision for credit losses. Credit card receivables associated with alleged or potential fraudulent transactions are charged off through noninterest expense—general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "Commercial and consumer banking loans are reported as delinquent when they become 30 or more days past due. For all commercial and consumer banking loans, we stop accruing interest and reverse all accrued but unpaid interest after 90 days of delinquency. For consumer banking loans, delinquent loans are charged off after 120 days of delinquency or on the date of confirmed loss. For commercial loans, performance is monitored on an individual loan basis and delinquent loans are charged off when collectability of interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured.\n",
      "Senior secured loans are term loan arrangements secured by underlying loans owned by the debtor. Senior secured loans are reported as delinquent when they become 30 or more days past due, and are charged off after 120 days of delinquency or on the date of confirmed loss.\n",
      "Financial Guarantees\n",
      "We entered into a credit default swap related to our student loans which meets the definition of a financial guarantee and is excluded from derivative accounting treatment. We apply the insurance contract claim method by deferring the full estimated amount of premiums paid and payable at inception. The deferred premium is estimated using a discounted cash flow model considering the expected performance of the reference portfolio and recorded within other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred premiums are amortized based on actual premiums due and recognized in noninterest expense—general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We recognize a receivable and related earnings when a loss event occurs, we have the right to submit a claim, and recovery is probable.\n",
      "Allowance for Credit Losses \n",
      "We primarily evaluate expected credit losses under the current expected credit loss model for the following financial assets: (i) cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, (ii) accounts receivable from contracts with customers, inclusive of servicing related receivables, (iii) loans measured at amortized cost, and (iv) investments in AFS debt securities. Our approaches to measuring the allowance for credit losses on the applicable financial assets are as follows: \n",

      "Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents: Our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents are short-term in nature and of high credit quality; therefore, we determined that our exposure to credit losses over the life of these instruments was immaterial. \n",
      "Accounts receivable from contracts with customers: Accounts receivable from contracts with customers as of the balance sheet dates, all of which are short-term in nature, are recorded at their original invoice amounts reduced by any allowance for credit losses. We assess the risk of loss for each individual customer, even when the risk is remote. Certain of our historical accounts receivable balances did not have any write-offs. We use the aging method and historical loss rates as a basis for estimating the percentage of current and delinquent accounts receivable balances that will result in credit losses. We consider whether the conditions at the measurement date and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future conditions, such as customer creditworthiness, current economic conditions, customer location, expectations of near-term economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and collection trends, warrant an adjustment to our historical loss experience. Based on this analysis, we determined that our historical loss rates remained most indicative of our lifetime expected losses. We record the provision for credit losses on accounts receivable from contracts with customers within noninterest expense—general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "When we determine that a receivable is not collectible, we write off the uncollectible amount as a reduction to both the allowance and the gross asset balance. Recoveries are recorded when received and credited to the provision for credit losses. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for credit losses being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. See Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses for a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses related to our accounts receivable. \n",
      "Senior secured loans: We evaluate the credit quality of our senior secured loan portfolio based on the fair value of underlying collateral, which are subject to the requirements of our loan underwriting process and risk models upon origination. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis utilizing a third-party valuation specialist, whereby the fair value of underlying collateral is reassessed based on relevant information such as funded loan rates and historical loss experience, among other factors. An allowance for credit losses is required when there is an expected credit loss after considering the fair value of the collateral as well as any anticipated future changes in the underlying collateral. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that our expected exposure to credit losses was immaterial, and as such did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on senior secured loans.\n",
      "Credit cards: We segment pools of credit cards based on consumer credit score bands as measured using FICO scores, which are obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed monthly thereafter, and also by delinquency status, which may be adjusted using other risk-differentiating attributes to model charge-off probabilities and the average life over which expected credit losses may occur for the credit cards within each pool. The pools estimate the likelihood of borrowers with similar FICO scores to pay credit obligations based on aggregate credit performance data. When necessary, we apply separate credit loss assumptions to assets that have deteriorated in credit quality such that they no longer share similar risk characteristics with other assets in the same FICO score band. We either estimate the allowance for credit losses on such non-performing assets individually based on individual risk characteristics or as part of a distinct pool of assets that shares similar risk characteristics. We reassess our credit card pools periodically to confirm that all loans within each pool continue to share similar risk characteristics.\n",
      "We establish an allowance within each pool of credit cards utilizing the risk model described above, which may then be adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, including economic conditions. We apply the probability-of-default and loss-given-default assumptions to the drawn balance of credit cards within each pool to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses within each pool, which are then aggregated to determine the allowance for credit losses. We do not measure credit losses on the undrawn credit exposure, as such undrawn credit exposure is unconditionally cancellable by us. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models, such as external conditions including regulatory requirements, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. We record the provision for credit losses on credit cards within noninterest expense—provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",

      "We elected to exclude interest on credit cards from the measurement of our allowance, as our policy allows for accrued interest to be reversed in a timely manner. Further, we elected the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest component of our credit cards from the quantitative disclosures presented.\n",
      "See Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses for a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses related to our credit cards.\n",
      "Commercial and consumer banking loans: We evaluate the credit quality of our commercial and consumer banking loan portfolio based on regulatory risk ratings. Loans are categorized into risk ratings based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The allowance for credit losses is determined at a portfolio level and estimated based on weighted average remaining maturity and annualized loss rate according to the loan’s regulatory loan type, risk rating classification and historical loss rates in the industry. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained.\n",

      "Investments in AFS debt securities: Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to noninterest expense—provision for credit losses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For certain securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or government agencies, or sovereign entities of high credit quality, we concluded that there is no risk of credit-related impairment due to the nature of the counterparties and history of no credit losses. For other investments in AFS debt securities, factors considered in evaluating credit losses include: (i) adverse conditions related to the macroeconomic environment or the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer, (ii) other credit indicators of the security, such as external credit ratings, and (iii) payment structure of the security. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on impaired investments in AFS debt securities.\n",
      "Servicing Rights \n",
      "Each time we enter into a servicing agreement, either in connection with transfers of our financial assets or in connection with a referral fulfillment arrangement in which we are a sub-servicer for financial assets that we do not legally own, we determine whether we should record a servicing asset or servicing liability. We elected the fair value option to measure our servicing rights subsequent to initial recognition. We measure the initial and subsequent fair value of our servicing rights using a discounted cash flow methodology, while also considering market data as it becomes available. The significant assumptions used in the valuation model include our contractual servicing fee, ancillary income, prepayment rate assumptions, default rate assumptions, a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the servicing asset or liability being valued, and an assumed market cost of servicing, which is based on active quotes from third-party servicers. The value of the servicing rights are dependent on the performance of the underlying loans. For servicing rights retained in connection with loan transfers that do not meet the requirements for sale accounting treatment, there is no recognition of a servicing asset or liability. \n",
      "Servicing rights in connection with transfers of financial assets are initially measured at fair value and recognized as a component of the gain or loss from sales of loans and the initial capitalization is reported within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Servicing rights assumed from third parties for financial assets for which we are not the loan originator are initially measured at fair value and recognized within noninterest income—servicing in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Servicing rights are measured at fair value at each subsequent reporting date and changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Subsequent measurement changes for all servicing rights, including servicing fee payments and fair value changes, are included within noninterest income—servicing in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We elected the fair value option to measure our servicing rights to better align with the valuation of our transferred loans, which also tend to share a similar risk profile to the personal loan servicing we assume from third parties when we are not the loan originator. The loans are also impacted by similar factors, such as conditional prepayment rates and default rates. We consider the risk of the assets and the observability of inputs in determining the classes of servicing rights. We have three classes of servicing assets: personal loans, student loans and home loans.\n",

      "Investments in Debt Securities\n",
      "The accounting and measurement framework for our investments in debt securities is determined based on the security classification. We do not hold investments in debt securities for trading purposes, nor do we have investments in debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity. Therefore, we classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. \n",
      "We record investments in AFS debt securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of AOCI. See Note 15. Fair Value Measurements for additional information on our fair value estimates for investments in AFS debt securities. The amortized cost basis of our investments in AFS debt securities reflects the security’s acquisition cost, adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount, and collection of cash and charge-offs, as applicable. For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses on AFS debt securities, the cost of securities sold is based on specific identification. We elected to present accrued interest for AFS debt securities within investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets. Purchase discounts, premiums, and other basis adjustments for investments in AFS debt securities are generally amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date. Amortization of premiums and discounts and other basis adjustments for investments in AFS debt securities, as well as interest income earned on the investments, are recognized within interest income—other, and realized gains and losses on investments in AFS debt securities are recognized within noninterest income—other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",
      "An investment in AFS debt security is considered impaired if its fair value is less than its amortized cost. If we determine that we have the intent to sell the impaired investment in AFS debt security, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired investment in AFS debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, we recognize the full impairment loss reflecting the difference between the amortized cost (net of any prior recognized allowance) and the fair value of the investment in AFS debt security within noninterest income—other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If neither of the above conditions exists, we evaluate whether the impairment loss is attributable to credit-related or non-credit-related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized within other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. See the section “Allowance for Credit Losses” in this Note for the factors we consider in identifying credit-related impairment and the treatment of credit losses.\n",

      "Securitization Investments \n",
      "In Company-sponsored securitization transactions that meet the applicable criteria to be accounted for as a sale, we retain certain residual interests and asset-backed bonds. We measure these investments at fair value on a recurring basis and report them within investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses related to our securitization investments are reported within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We determine the fair value of our securitization investments using a discounted cash flow methodology, while also considering market data as it becomes available.\n",
      "Our residual investments accrete interest income over the expected life using the effective yield method, which reflects a portion of the overall fair value adjustment recorded each period on our residual investments. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the cash flow estimates over the life of the residual investments to determine if a change to the accretable yield is required on a prospective basis. Additionally, we record interest income associated with asset-backed bonds over the term of the underlying bond using the effective interest method on unpaid bond amounts. Interest income on residual investments and asset-backed bonds is presented within interest income—loans and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",

      "All property, equipment and software are initially recorded at cost, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Computer hardware, furniture and fixtures, software, buildings and finance lease ROU assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable or amortizable assets (ranging from one to 30 years). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the respective lease term or the estimated lives of the leasehold improvements. \n",
      "Software includes both purchased and internally-developed software. Internally-developed software is capitalized when preliminary project efforts are successfully completed, and it is probable that both the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs consist of salaries and compensation costs (inclusive of share-based compensation) for employees, fees paid to third-party consultants who are directly involved in development efforts and costs incurred for upgrades and functionality enhancements, and are amortized over a useful life ranging from 2.5 to 3 years. Other costs are expensed as incurred.\n",

      "Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n",
      "Goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. We may assess goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach, referred to as “step zero”, to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine if there is any impairment. We may alternatively elect to initially perform a quantitative assessment and bypass the qualitative assessment. \n",
      "A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Therefore, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. Our reporting units for our goodwill impairment analysis represent components of our business at one level below our operating segments. Our annual impairment testing date is October 1.\n",
      "Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Intangible assets include capitalized costs incurred in the development and enhancement of our software products to be sold, leased or marketed. These costs, consisting primarily of salaries and compensation costs (inclusive of share-based compensation) for employees, are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, after which the costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.\n",

      "lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. For our current classes of finance leases, we did not elect to apply this practical expedient and, instead, separately identify and measure the non-lease components of the contracts. As an accounting policy election, we apply the short-term lease exemption practical expedient to any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise. \n",
      "Operating leases are presented within operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are presented within property, equipment and software and finance lease liabilities are presented within accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Operating and finance lease ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating and finance lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date or modification date, as appropriate, in determining the present value of lease payments. \n",
      "The operating lease ROU assets are increased by any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any unamortized lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Base rent is typically subject to rent escalations on each annual anniversary from the lease commencement dates. Lease expense for lease payments, including any step rent provisions specified in the lease agreements, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is allocated among the components of noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The finance lease ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of seven years. Interest expense on finance leases is recognized for the difference between the present value of the lease liabilities and the scheduled lease payments within interest expense—other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. \n",
      "When a lease agreement is modified, we determine if the modification grants us the right to use an additional asset that is not included in the original lease contract and if the lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional ROU asset. If both conditions are met, we account for the agreement as two separate contracts: (i) the original, unmodified contract and (ii) a separate contract for the additional ROU asset. If both conditions are not met, the modification is not evaluated as a separate contract. Instead, based on the nature of the modification, we: (i) reassess the lease classification on the modification date under the modified terms, and (ii) use the modified lease payments and discount rate to remeasure the lease liability and recognize any difference between the new lease liability and the old lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU asset.\n",

We did not elect hedge accounting, as management’s hedging intentions are to economically hedge the risk of unfavorable changes in the fair values of our personal loans, student loans and home loans. Our derivative instruments used to manage future loan sale execution risk include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and home loan pipeline hedges. We also have IRLCs, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps that were not related to future loan sale execution risk. \n",

      "Safeguarding Asset and Liability\n",
      "Through our SoFi Invest product (via our wholly-owned subsidiary, SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, a licensed money transmitter), our members were able to invest in digital assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we transferred the crypto services provided by SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, and began closing existing digital assets accounts. This process was completed in the first quarter of 2024. Certain accounts were eligible for transfer to a third party digital asset service provider who assumed responsibility for the transferred accounts on a go-forward basis, including the arrangement of custodial services for the transferred digital assets. We have no further ongoing responsibilities for the transferred digital assets subsequent to the executed transfer which took place in December 2023, and derecognized the corresponding digital assets safeguarding liability and safeguarding asset as of the date of the transfer.\n",
      "For those digital assets that were not eligible to be transferred, we engage third parties to provide custodial services for our digital assets offering, which include holding the cryptographic key information and working to protect the digital assets from loss or theft. The third-party custodians hold digital assets as custodial assets in an account in SoFi’s name for the benefit of our members. We maintain the internal recordkeeping of our members’ digital assets, including the amount and type of digital assets owned by each of our members in the custodial accounts. As of December 31, 2023, we utilized one third-party custodian.\n",
      "In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (“SAB 121”), we recognize a digital assets safeguarding liability within accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets reflecting our obligation to safeguard the digital assets held by third-party custodians for the benefit of our members. We also recognize a corresponding safeguarding asset within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset are measured and recorded at the fair value of the digital assets held by the custodians at each reporting date. Subsequent changes to the fair value measurement are reflected as equal and offsetting adjustments to the carrying values of the safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset. We evaluate any potential loss events, such as theft, loss or destruction of the cryptographic keys, that may affect the measurement of the safeguarding asset, which would be reflected in our results of operations in the period the loss occurs. Measurement changes do not impact the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss unless such a loss event is identified. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not identify any loss events.\n",

The capitalized debt issuance costs and the original issue discount/premium are amortized into interest expense over the expected life of the related financing agreements using the straight-line method for revolving facilities and the effective interest method for securitization debt and our senior convertible notes, as defined and further discussed below. Remaining unamortized fees are expensed immediately upon early extinguishment of the debt. In a debt modification for revolving debt, the initial issuance costs and any additional fees incurred as a result of the modification are deferred over the term of the new agreement, if the borrowing capacity of the revolving facility is increased. In the case that a modification results in a decrease in our borrowing capacity, any fees paid to the creditor and any third-party costs incurred are considered to be associated with the new arrangement and are, therefore, deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement. Unamortized deferred costs relating to the old arrangement at the time of the modification are expensed immediately in proportion to the decrease in borrowing capacity of the old arrangement. Any remaining unamortized deferred costs relating to the old arrangement are deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement. \n",

For securitization debt carried at fair value on a recurring basis, we record the initial fair value measurement and subsequent measurement changes in fair value in the period in which the changes occur within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, based on the applicable conversion rate(s). The convertible notes will also be redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after October 15, 2024 through the 30th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if certain liquidity conditions described in the indenture are satisfied and certain conditions are met with respect to the last reported sale price per share of our common stock prior to conversion. In December 2023, we entered into repurchase agreements to repurchase $88.0 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes. See Note 12. Debt for more detailed disclosure of the term and features of the convertible notes. \n",
      "We elected to evaluate each embedded feature of the arrangement individually. We concluded that each of the conversion rights, optional redemption rights, fundamental change make-whole provision and repurchase rights did not require bifurcation as derivative instruments, which we reevaluate each reporting period. The additional interest and special interest that accrue on the notes in the event of our failure to comply with certain registration or reporting requirements are required to be bifurcated from the host contract, as the reporting requirement triggering event is not clearly and closely related to the host convertible debt contract, and therefore we measure the contingent interest feature at fair value each reporting period. The value was determined to be immaterial; therefore, we accounted for the convertible notes wholly as debt, which was recognized on the settlement date. Accordingly, we allocated all debt issuance costs to the debt instrument on the basis of materiality.\n",

The Capped Call Transactions initially cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the convertible notes. The Capped Call Transactions are net purchased call options on our own common stock. The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the Company with each of the Capped Call Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the convertible notes, and do not affect any holder’s rights under the convertible notes. Holders of the convertible notes do not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. As the Capped Call Transactions are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the convertible notes, they were evaluated as freestanding instruments.

Share-based compensation expense is allocated among the following categories of expenses within noninterest expense: (i) technology and product development, (ii) sales and marketing, (iii) cost of operations, and (iv) general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (the “Black-Scholes Model”) to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options. RSUs are measured based on the fair values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the grant-date fair value of PSUs. We recognize forfeitures as incurred and, therefore, reverse previously recognized share-based compensation expense at the time of forfeiture. See Note 16. Share-Based Compensation for further discussion of share-based compensation.\n",

      "We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management reviews all available positive and negative evidence. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. \n",
      "The tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the tax position would more likely than not be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the tax position. Management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all jurisdictions. We accrue tax penalties and interest, if any, as incurred and recognize them within income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n",

      "In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The ASU addresses two topics: (i) TDR by creditors, and (ii) vintage disclosures for gross write offs. Under the TDR provisions, the ASU eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance under ASC 310-40, Receivables — Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, and instead requires that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent with the accounting for other loan modifications. Additionally, the ASU enhances existing disclosure requirements around TDRs and introduces new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Under the vintage disclosure provisions, the ASU requires the entity to disclose current period gross write offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses — Measured at Amortized Cost. The standard should be applied prospectively; however, for the TDR provisions, an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n",

      "On January 7, 2021, Social Finance entered into an agreement by and among Social Finance, SCH, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares, and Plutus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SCH (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Social Finance. Upon the Closing on May 28, 2021, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased and Social Finance survived the merger and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCH. On May 28, 2021, SCH also filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, under which SCH was domesticated as a Delaware corporation, changing its name from “Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V” to “SoFi Technologies, Inc.” These transactions are collectively referred to as the “Business Combination”.\n",
      "The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization whereby SCH was determined to be the accounting acquiree and Social Finance to be the accounting acquirer. This accounting treatment was the equivalent of Social Finance issuing stock for the net assets of SCH, accompanied by a recapitalization whereby no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Social Finance. At the Closing, we received gross cash consideration of $764.8 million as a result of the reverse recapitalization, which was then reduced by: (i) a redemption of redeemable common stock (classified as temporary equity) of $150.0 million, (ii) a special payment made to our \n",

      "In connection with the Business Combination, SCH entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the “Third Party PIPE Investors”), whereby it issued 122,500,000 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share (“PIPE Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $1.225 billion (“PIPE Investment”), which closed simultaneously with the consummation of the Business Combination. Upon the Closing, the PIPE Shares were automatically converted into shares of SoFi Technologies common stock on a one-for-one basis.\n",

In the business combination, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Golden Pacific for total cash purchase consideration of $22.3 million (the “Bank Merger”). The acquisition was not determined to be a significant acquisition. After closing the Bank Merger, we became a bank holding company and Golden Pacific began operating as SoFi Bank. We are duly registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve. SoFi Bank is a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the OCC. Deposit accounts of SoFi Bank are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law. \n",
      "The closing of the Bank Merger was subject to regulatory approval. On January 18, 2022, we received approval from the Federal Reserve of our application to become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and we received conditional approval from the OCC to close the Bank Merger. The OCC also approved our application to change the composition of Golden Pacific’s assets in connection with the Bank Merger. The OCC conditional approval imposed a number of conditions, including that SoFi Bank have initial paid-in capital of no less than $750 million and adhere to an operating agreement. Golden Pacific’s community bank business continues to operate as a division of SoFi Bank.\n",
      " A portion of the total cash purchase consideration ($0.6 million) was held back by the Company to satisfy any indemnification or certain other obligations (“Holdback Amount”), as certain legal proceedings with which Golden Pacific is involved as a plaintiff were not resolved at the time the Bank Merger closed. During 2022, we incurred costs associated with the litigation involving Golden Pacific as a plaintiff in excess of the Holdback Amount. Therefore, none of the Holdback Amount will be released to the Golden Pacific shareholders. Additionally, we held back a $3.3 million payable to a dissenting Golden Pacific shareholder pending resolution of the shareholder’s dissenter’s rights appraisal claim. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the appraisal claim was settled and payment was released.\n",

In the business combination, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Technisys for a preliminary purchase consideration of $915.4 million. During the third quarter of 2022, we finalized the closing net working capital calculation specified in the merger agreement, which resulted in a reduction to the equity consideration of 155,794 shares, representing an adjustment to the total purchase consideration of $1,665, and a corresponding reduction to the carrying value of recognized goodwill. The remaining 442,274 shares that were held in escrow associated with the working capital calculation were released to the former Technisys shareholders.

      "We earn fees for providing an integrated platform as a service for financial and non-financial institutions. Within our technology products and solutions fee arrangements, certain contracts contain a provision for a fixed, upfront implementation fee related to setup activities, which represents an advance payment for future technology platform services provided over the contract term. These implementation fees are recognized ratably over the contract life. \n",
      "Commencing in March 2022 with the Technisys Merger, we earn subscription and service fees for providing software licenses and associated services, including implementation and maintenance. We charge a recurring subscription fee for the software license and related maintenance services. Other software-related services are billed on a periodic basis as the services are provided. Certain arrangements for software and related services contain a provision for a fixed upfront payment. \n",
      "We recognize revenue related to software licenses at a point in time upon delivery of the license and the close of the user-acceptance testing period. When implementation services are distinct, we recognize revenue over time during the implementation period. We recognize maintenance services ratably over the contractual maintenance term. If a fixed upfront payment provides a material right to the customer, we recognize revenue associated with the material right over the period of benefit associated with the right to subscribe or renew a subscription, which is typically the product life.\n",
      "We allocate fees charged for software and related services to our performance obligations on the basis of the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling prices either represent the prices at which we separately sell each license or service or are estimated using available information, such as market conditions and internal pricing policies. The standalone selling price of the software license and maintenance are determined based on the complexity and size of the license.\n",
      "Payments to customers: We may provide incentives to our technology platform customers, which may be payable up front or applied to future or past technology products and solutions fees. Evaluating whether such incentives are payments to a customer requires judgment. When we determine that an incentive is consideration payable to a customer, the incentive is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Incentives that represent consideration payable to a customer may also contain variable consideration. Therefore, such incentives are constraints on the revenue expected to be realized. Upfront customer incentives are recorded as prepaid assets and presented within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and are applied against revenue in the period such incentives are earned by the customer. Any incentive in excess of cumulative revenue is expensed as a contract cost.\n",

In one type of referral arrangement, we refer end users through our platform to third-party enterprise partners.

In another type of referral arrangement, we earn referral fulfillment fees for providing pre-qualified borrower referrals to a third-party partner who separately contracts with a loan originator. Our referral fees are based on the referred loan amount, subject to a referral fulfillment fee penalty if a loan is determined to be ineligible and becomes a charged-off loan as defined in the contract.

      "We regularly transfer financial assets and account for such transfers as either sales or secured borrowings depending on the facts and circumstances of the transfer. When a transfer of financial assets qualifies as a sale, in many instances we have continuing involvement as the servicer of those financial assets. As we expect the benefits of servicing to be more than just adequate, we recognize a servicing asset. Further, in the case of securitization-related transfers that qualify as sales, we have additional continuing involvement as an investor, albeit at insignificant levels relative to the expected gains and losses of the securitization. In instances where a transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing, we perform servicing (but we do not recognize a servicing asset) and typically maintain a significant investment relative to the expected gains and losses of the securitization. In whole loan sales, we do not have a residual financial interest in the loans, nor do we have any other power over the loans that would constrain us from recognizing a sale. Additionally, we generally have no repurchase requirements related to transfers of personal loans, student loans and non-GSE home loans other than standard origination representations and warranties, for which we record a liability based on expected repurchase obligations.

      "Our allowance for credit losses represents our current estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of certain financial assets, including credit cards as well as commercial and consumer banking loans acquired in the Bank Merger, which relate to our Financial Services segment, and accounts receivables primarily related to our Technology Platform segment. Given our methods of collecting funds on servicing receivables, our historical experience of infrequent write offs, and that we have not observed meaningful changes in our counterparties’ abilities to pay, we determined that the future exposure to credit losses on servicing related receivables was immaterial. \n",
      "In estimating expected credit losses for credit cards, we segment loans based on credit quality indicators and reassess our pools periodically to confirm that all loans within each pool continue to share similar risk characteristics. We establish an allowance within each pool utilizing a proprietary risk model that relies on assumptions such as average annual percentage rate, payment rate, utilization, delinquency status and default probability. The model may then be adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, including economic conditions. We apply the aforementioned assumptions to the drawn balance of credit cards within each pool to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses within each pool, which are then aggregated to determine the allowance for credit losses. \n",
      "We evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models, such as external conditions including regulatory requirements, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. When a credit card balance is charged off, we record a reduction to the allowance and the credit card balance. \n",

The Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to issue SoFi Technologies Preferred Stock and SoFi Technologies Redeemable Preferred Stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. The authorized shares of SoFi Technologies Redeemable Preferred Stock is inclusive of 4,500,000 shares of Series 1 redeemable preferred stock (“Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock”), which reflect the conversion on a one-for-one basis of shares of Social Finance Series 1 preferred stock in conjunction with the Business Combination. Shares of SoFi Technologies Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company will be canceled and may not be reissued by the Company. The Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock remains classified as temporary equity because the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock is not fully controlled by the issuer, SoFi Technologies. See “Series 1 Preference and Rights” for additional provisions of the SoFi Technologies Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock.\n",

In conjunction with the Business Combination, the Amended Series 1 Agreement amended the special payment provision under the original agreement to provide for a one-time special payment of $21.2 million to the holders of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, which was paid from the proceeds of the Business Combination and settled contemporaneously with the Business Combination.

      "Prior to the Business Combination, no dividends were declared or paid subject to the preferred stock dividend provisions. Subsequent to the Business Combination, the dividend provisions were no longer in effect.\n",
      "Pursuant to the SoFi Technologies Certificate of Incorporation, the SoFi Technologies Series 1 preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends from and including the date of issuance of such shares at a fixed rate equal to $12.50 per annum per share, or 12.5% per annum, of the SoFi Technologies Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock share price of $100.00 (“Series 1 Dividend Rate”). The Series 1 Dividend Rate resets to a new fixed rate on the fifth anniversary of May 29, 2019, the original Series 1 preferred stock issue date (“Series 1 Original Issue Date”) and on every subsequent one-year anniversary of the Series 1 Original Issue Date (“Dividend Reset Date”), equal to the term benchmark rate applicable to revolving loans denominated in U.S. dollars in our revolving credit facility, i.e. a benchmark rate equal to Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% as in effect on the dividend determination date plus a spread of 9.94% per annum. Series 1 preferred stockholders prior to the Business Combination who received shares of SoFi Technologies Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock at the effective time of the Merger remained entitled to receive dividends accrued but unpaid as of the date of the Agreement in respect of such shares of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock.\n",
      "During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Series 1 preferred stockholders were entitled to dividends of $40,425, $40,425 and $40,426, respectively. There were no dividends payable as of December 31, 2023.\n",
      "Dividends are payable semiannually in arrears on the 30th day of June and 31st day of December of each year, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors. The Company may defer any scheduled dividend payment for up to three semiannual dividend periods, subject to such deferred dividend accumulating and compounding at the applicable Series 1 Dividend Rate. If the Company defers any single scheduled dividend payment on the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock for four or more semiannual dividend periods, the Series 1 Dividend Rate applicable to: (i) the compounding following the date of such default on all then-deferred dividend payments (whether or not deferred for four or more semiannual dividend periods) is applied on a go-forward basis and not retroactively, and (ii) new dividends declared following the date of such default and the compounding on such dividends if such new dividends are deferred shall be equal to the otherwise applicable Series 1 Dividend Rate plus 400 basis points. This default-related increase shall continue to apply until the Company pays all deferred dividends and related compounding. Once the Company is current on all such dividends, it may again commence deferral of any pre-scheduled dividend payment for up to three semiannual dividend periods, following the same procedure as outlined in the foregoing.\n",

      "Pursuant to the SoFi Technologies Certificate of Incorporation, the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock is redeemable at SoFi’s option in certain circumstances. SoFi may, at any time but no more than three times, at its option, settle the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, but if in part, in an amount no less than: (i) one-third of the total amount of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding as of May 28, 2021 or (ii) the remainder of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding (the “Minimum Redemption Amount”). In addition, SoFi may, at its option, settle for cash the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, within 120 days of the occurrence of a Change of Control (as that term is defined in the SoFi Technologies Certificate of Incorporation), which would result in a payment of the initial purchase price of the Series 1 preferred stock of $323.4 million plus any unpaid dividends on such stock (whether deferred or otherwise) (the “Series 1 Redemption Price”). Such settlement is determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. If any such optional redemption by the Company occurs either: (i) prior to the fifth anniversary of the Series 1 Original Issue Date or (ii) after the fifth anniversary of the Series 1 Original Issue Date and not on a Dividend Reset Date, the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock is entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to any such dividends that would have otherwise been payable to the holder on its redeemed shares of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock for all dividend periods following the applicable optional redemption date up to and including the Dividend Reset Date immediately following such optional redemption date.\n",
      "If the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock is not earlier redeemed by the Company, each holder of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock has the right to require SoFi to settle for cash some or all of their Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, in each case at the Series 1 Redemption Price, in the following circumstances: (i) within 120 days of the occurrence of a Change of Control, or (ii) during the six-month period following (a) a default in payment of any dividend on the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock, or (b) the cure period for any covenant default under the SoFi Technologies Certificate of Incorporation. The Series 1 preferred stock had similar redemption provisions under the Original Series 1 Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Series 1 Agreement, in January 2021, the Series 1 preferred stockholders waived their rights in the event of a liquidation, including the right to immediately receive the Series 1 proceeds. Therefore, the Series 1 preferred stock redemption value remained at $323.4 million subsequent to the Business Combination. The Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock remains in temporary equity following the Business Combination because the Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock is not fully controlled by SoFi. \n",

      "In connection with the Series 1 and Series H preferred stock issuances during the year ended December 31, 2019, we also issued 12,170,990 Series H warrants, which were initially accounted for as liabilities, and were included within accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Series H preferred stock was converted into shares of SoFi Technologies common stock in conjunction with the Business Combination.\n",
      "Prior to the Business Combination, the Series H warrants were measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 because of our reliance on unobservable assumptions, with fair value changes recognized within noninterest expense—general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. On May 28, 2021, in conjunction with the Closing of the Business Combination, we measured the final fair value of our Series H warrants. Subsequently, we reclassified the Series H warrant liability of $161,775 into permanent equity, as the terms of the Series H instrument no longer necessitated liability accounting. Therefore, we did not measure the warrants at fair value subsequent to May 28, 2021.\n",

      "•Risk-free interest rate — Based on the five-year U.S. Treasury rate, which was commensurate with the expected term of the warrants. At inception, we assumed that the term would be five years, given by design the warrants were only expected to extend for greater than five years if the Company was still not publicly traded by that point in time. The expected term assumption used reflects the five-year term less time elapsed since initial measurement. An increase in the expected term, in isolation, would typically correlate to a higher risk-free interest rate and result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.\n",
      "•Expected volatility — Reflected the expectation that the Series H warrants would convert into common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination, and the Series H preference would be of no further effect, in which case the Series H preference would not have a material impact on the stock volatility measure. As such, the expected volatility assumptions reflect our common stock volatilities as of May 28, 2021. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.\n",
      "•Fair value of Series H preferred stock — Determined as of May 28, 2021, which was informed from a common stock transaction during December 2020 at a price of $10.57 per common share. We determined that this common stock transaction was a reasonable proxy for the valuation of the Series H preferred stock as of May 28, 2021 due to the proximity to an expected Business Combination; therefore, other than adjusting for the Series H exchange ratio, no further adjustments were made for the Series H concluded price per share. As of May 28, 2021, the fair value measurement of the Series H redeemable preferred stock was determined based on the observable closing price of SCH stock (ticker symbol “IPOE”) on the measurement date multiplied by the weighted average exchange ratio of the Series H preferred stock.\n",
      "•Dividend yield — We assumed no dividend yield because we have historically not paid out dividends to our preferred stockholders, other than to the Series 1 preferred stockholders, which is considered a special circumstance.\n",

Purchase activity included securitization clean-up calls of $39,936 during the year ended December 31, 2023, and $518,659 during the year ended December 31, 2022. The remaining purchases during the periods presented related to standard representations and warranties pursuant to our various loan sale agreements. Issuances represent the principal balance of loans originated during the period. Settlements represent principal payments made on loans during the period. Other changes represent fair value adjustments that impact the balance sheet primarily associated with whole loan strategic repurchases, clean up calls and consolidated securitizations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had $66,198 of transfers out of Level 3 related to our home loans related to an update to pricing sources utilized by third-party valuation specialists. Impacts on earnings for loans at fair value are recorded within interest income—loans and securitizations, within noninterest income—loan origination, sales, and securitizations, and within noninterest expense—general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. \n",

      "(4)For IRLCs and student loan commitments, settlements reflect funded and unfunded adjustments representing the unpaid principal balance of funded and unfunded loans during the quarter multiplied by the IRLC or student loan commitment price in effect at the beginning of the quarter. Purchases of IRLCs during the year ended December 31, 2023 were associated with our acquisition of Wyndham. For year-to-date periods, amounts represent the summation of the per-quarter effects.

      "Loans at Fair Value\n",
      "Gains and losses recognized in earnings include changes in accumulated interest and fair value adjustments on loans originated during the period and on loans held at the balance sheet date, as well as loan charge-offs. Changes in fair value are primarily impacted by valuation assumption changes as well as sales price execution. The estimated amount of gains (losses) included in earnings attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk was $(26,625), $(49,453) and $4,143 during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gains (losses) attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating our current default and loss severity assumptions for the loans. These assumptions are based on historical performance, market trends and performance expectations over the term of the underlying instrument.\n",

      "Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Level 3 fair value measurements include unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which there is little or no market data, which requires us to develop our own assumptions. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

      "Prior to the Business Combination, the Company’s Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Option Plan (the “2011 Plan”) allowed the Company to grant shares of common stock to employees, non-employee directors and non-employee third parties. As of December 31, 2023, outstanding awards to non-employee third parties under the 2011 Plan were not material. The Company also had shares authorized under a stock plan assumed in a 2020 business combination, which were assumed by the 2011 Plan. Upon the Closing, the remaining unallocated share reserve under the 2011 Plan was cancelled and no new awards may be granted under such plan. Awards outstanding under the 2011 Plan were assumed by SoFi Technologies upon the Closing and continue to be governed by the terms of the 2011 Plan.\n",

Under the 2021 Plan, effective January 1, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the issuance of an additional 8,937,242 shares. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Amended and Restated 2021 Plan”), including a modification to the evergreen provision and an increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan. As of December 31, 2023, the Amended and Restated 2021 Plan includes an aggregate of 151,677,954 shares of common stock authorized for issuance of awards. The Amended and Restated 2021 Plan allows for the number of authorized shares to increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on and including January 1, 2030 equal to the lesser of (a) five percent of the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) such smaller number of shares of common stock as determined by the Board of Directors. The Amended and Restated 2021 Plan allows for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs (including PSUs), dividend equivalents and other stock or cash based awards for issuance to its employees, non-employee directors and non-employee third parties. Shares associated with option exercises and RSU vesting are issued from the authorized pool. \n",

DSUs are equity awards that entitle the holder to shares of our common stock when the awards vest. Directors may choose to receive their deferred stock distributions in a lump sum or in installments over different time periods. DSUs are measured based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. DSU activity is presented with RSUs in the disclosures below.\n",

      "Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, residual investments and loans. We hold cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in accounts at regulated domestic financial institutions in amounts that may exceed FDIC insured amounts. We believe these institutions are of high credit quality. \n",
      "We are dependent on third-party funding sources and deposit balances to originate loans. Additionally, we sell loans to various third parties. We have historically sold loans to a limited pool of third-party buyers. No individual third-party buyer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated total net revenues for the periods presented.\n",

As such, the loss of one or a few of our top clients could be significant to that portion of our business. No individual client accounted for 10% or more of consolidated total net revenues for the periods presented. \n",

There is no single borrower or group of borrowers that comprise a significant concentration of the Company’s loan portfolio. Likewise, the Company is not overly concentrated within a group of channel partners or other customers, with the exception of our distribution of personal loan residual interests in our sponsored personal loan securitizations, which we market to third parties, and the aforementioned whole loan buyers. Given we have a limited number of prospective buyers for our personal loan securitization residual interests, this might result in us utilizing a significant amount of deposits or our own capital to fund future residual interests in personal loan securitizations, or impact the execution of future securitizations if we are limited in our own ability to invest in the residual interest portion of future securitizations, or find willing buyers for securitization residual interests. \n",

While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, we believe that any ultimate liability arising from any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, many of these matters are in various stages of proceedings and further developments could cause management to revise its assessment of these matters. Our assessments are based on our knowledge and historical experience, as well as the specific facts and circumstances asserted, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed. Regardless of the final outcome, defending lawsuits, claims, government and self-regulatory organization investigations, and proceedings in which we are involved is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that we will receive favorable final outcomes.\n",
      "Guarantees\n",
      "We have three types of repurchase obligations that we account for as financial guarantees. First, we issue financial guarantees to GSEs on loans that we sell to GSEs, which manifest as repurchase requirements if it is later discovered that loans sold to a GSE do not meet their guidelines. We have a three-year repurchase obligation from the time of origination to buy back originated loans that do not meet GSE guidelines, and we are required to pay the full initial purchase price back to the GSE. We recognize a liability for the full amount of expected loan repurchases, which we estimate based on historical repurchase activity for similar types of loans and assess whether adjustments to our historical loss experience are required based on current conditions and forecasts of future conditions, as appropriate, as our exposure under the guarantee is typically short-term in nature. The liability we record is equal to what we expect to buy back and, therefore, approximates fair value. Second, we make standard representations and warranties related to other loan transfers, breaches of which would require us to repurchase the transferred loans. Finally, we have limited repurchase obligations for certain loan transfers associated with credit-related events, such as early prepayment or events of default within 90 days after origination. In the event of a repurchase, we are typically required to pay the purchase price of the loans transferred. \n",

      "Prior to the Business Combination, our participating interests included all series of our preferred stock, and we computed loss per share attributable to common stock using the two-class method required for participating interests. Prior to the Business Combination, all other classes of preferred stock, except for Series C, had stated dividend rights, which had priority over undistributed earnings. The remaining losses were shared pro-rata among the preferred stock (with the exception of Series 1 preferred stock) and common stock outstanding during the measurement period, as if all of the losses for the period had been distributed. While our calculation of loss per share accounted for a loss allocation to all participating shares, we only presented loss per share below for our common stock. \n",
      "Subsequent to the Business Combination, we did not have any participating interests. Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock has preferential cumulative dividend rights. For each period presented, we increased net loss by the contractual amount of dividends payable to holders of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock. \n",
      "Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss, adjusted for the impact of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock dividends, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. \n",
      "Diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the impact of Series 1 Redeemable Preferred Stock dividends, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of contingently issuable shares including PSU awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock, RSUs, outstanding options, outstanding warrants and dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible notes, if applicable. The adjustment for convertible notes reflects the conversion price at the end of the reporting period. We excluded the effect of all potentially dilutive common stock elements from the denominator in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share in the periods where their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. \n",

      "During the first quarter of 2022, we implemented an FTP framework to attribute net interest income to our business segments based on their usage and/or provision of funding. The primary objective of the FTP framework is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration of funding of assets and liabilities to allocate interest income and interest expense to each segment. Therefore, the financial impact, management and reporting of interest rate risk is centralized in Corporate/Other, where it is monitored and managed. Under the FTP framework, treasury provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits, and a funds charge for the use of funds, such as loan originations and credit card. The process for determining FTP credits and charges is based on a number of factors and assumptions, including prevailing market interest rates, the expected duration of interest-earning and interest-bearing assets and liabilities, contingent risks and behaviors, and our broader funding profile. As the durations of assets and liabilities are typically not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP framework is reflected within Corporate/Other. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in further refinements or changes to the framework in future periods. The application of the FTP framework impacts the measure of net interest income and, thereby, total net revenue and contribution profit (loss) for our reportable segments, as well as the total net revenue of Corporate/Other, but has no impact on our consolidated results of operations.\n",
      "Prior to implementing the FTP framework, the presentation of our Lending and Financial Services segments’ net interest income reflected the difference between interest income earned on our loans and the actual interest expense incurred on any loans that were financed. Under the FTP framework, such interest expense is incurred by treasury within Corporate/Other and replaced by an FTP charge. Application of our current FTP framework during the comparative year ended December 31, 2021 would not have had a material impact on Lending or Financial Services segment net interest income.\n",
      "The accounting policies of our reportable segments are consistent with those described in Note 1. Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards, except for the application of the FTP framework and the allocations of consolidated income and consolidated expenses. Assets are not allocated to reportable segments, as our CODM does not evaluate reportable segments using discrete asset information.\n",

      "Lending.  The Lending segment includes our personal loan, student loan and home loan products and the related servicing activities. Revenues in the Lending segment are driven by changes in the fair value of our whole loans and securitization interests (inclusive of our economic hedging activities), gains or losses recognized on transfers that meet the true sale requirements, and our servicing-related activities, which mainly consist of servicing fees and the changes in our servicing assets over time. In our Lending segment, we also earn the difference between interest income earned on our loans and interest expense as determined using the FTP framework for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the majority of the year ended December 31, 2022, and from our warehouse financing for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our CODM considers net interest income in addition to contribution profit in evaluating the performance of our Lending segment and making resource allocation decisions. Therefore, we present interest income net of interest expense.\n",
      "Technology Platform. The Technology Platform segment includes: (i) technology products and solutions revenue, which is primarily related to our platform as a service through Galileo, which provides the infrastructure to facilitate core client-facing and back-end capabilities, such as account setup, account funding, direct deposit, authorizations and processing, payments functionality and check account balance features, (ii) beginning in March 2022, revenue earned by Technisys, which \n",

      "Financial Services.  The Financial Services segment primarily includes our SoFi Money product (primarily inclusive of checking and savings accounts, as well as cash management accounts), SoFi Invest product, SoFi Credit Card product, SoFi Relay personal finance management product and other financial services, such as lead generation and content for other financial services institutions and our members. Checking and savings provides members a digital banking experience that offers no account fees, 2-day early paycheck and a competitive annual percentage yield. SoFi Money cash management provides members a digital cash management experience. SoFi Invest provides investment features and financial planning services that we offer to our members. Revenues in the Financial Services segment include interest income earned and interest expense incurred under the FTP framework, interchange fees on our member debit and credit transactions, and fees related to pay for order flow and share lending arrangements in SoFi Invest. We also earn referral fees in connection with referral activity we facilitate through our platform.\n",

      "Corporate/Other.  Non-segment operations are classified as Corporate/Other, which includes net revenues associated with corporate functions that are not directly related to a reportable segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, net interest income (expense) within Corporate/Other reflects the residual impact from FTP charges and FTP credits allocated to our reportable segments under our FTP framework. These non-segment net revenue (loss) also include interest income earned on corporate cash balances, nonrecurring income on certain investments from available cash on hand, such as our investments in AFS debt securities (which investments are not interconnected with our core business lines and, thereby, reportable segments), noninterest income related to gains and losses on extinguishment of corporate borrowings including our convertible notes, and interest expense on other corporate borrowings, such as our revolving credit facility and the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount on our convertible notes.\n",

These obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with fair value changes recorded within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value change attributable to assumption changes has no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest claims are limited to securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. As such, this non-cash change in fair value during the period is adjusted to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the cash flows available to finance our operations. \n",

      "SoFi Technologies, a bank holding company, and SoFi Bank, a nationally chartered association, are required to comply with regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and FDIC. From time to time, we may contribute capital to SoFi Bank. We are required to manage our capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and support our business activities, including the requirement to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standardized approach for U.S. banking organizations (U.S. Basel III). If the Federal Reserve finds that we are not “well-capitalized” or “well-managed”, we would be required to take remedial action, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. \n",
      "The Federal Reserve and the OCC have authority to prohibit bank holding companies and banks, respectively, from paying dividends if, in their opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Under the National Bank Act, SoFi Bank generally may, without prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend so long as the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, in the current year do not exceed net income for the current year to date plus retained net income for the prior two years. However, taking into account a wide range of factors, the OCC may object and therefore prevent SoFi Bank from paying dividends to the Company. As such, as of December 31, 2023, the Bank would not have any funds free of restrictions that are available for dividend payments. Restrictions on the ability of SoFi Bank to pay dividends to the parent company could also impact the Company’s ability to pay dividends to common stockholders.\n",
      "Additionally, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, our bank holding company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if we do not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer, as discussed below. Further, a policy statement of the Federal Reserve provides that, among other things, a bank holding company generally should not pay dividends on regulatory capital instruments if its net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Based on this Federal Reserve policy, as of December 31, 2023, the Company generally would not have any funds free of restrictions available for dividend payments on regulatory capital instruments.\n",
      "These requirements establish required minimum ratios for CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and a Tier 1 leverage ratio; set risk-weighting for assets and certain other items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. Additionally, regulatory capital rules include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that is added on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have authority to require banking organizations subject to their supervision to hold additional amounts of capital in excess of the minimum risk-based capital ratios.\n",

      "Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n",
      "We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SoFi Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n",
      "We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n",
      "Basis for Opinion\n",
      "The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n",
      "We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n",
      "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n",
      "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",
